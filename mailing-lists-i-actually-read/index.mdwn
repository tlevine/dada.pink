# Mailing lists I actually read
I'm think these are the only email lists where I actually read most of the
emails. And I've been on a couple of them for a while; they must be pretty good.

## altkeyboards
I've been on
[altkeyboards](http://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/altkeyboards/info)
since May 9, 2015. It used to be a bit more active, but now it's usually
a few emails per year, all within a few days of each other.
And they're always super awesome.

My favorite incident ever was the controversy that erupted around one
guy's grand vision to spread Dvorak to everyone and to hold computer
manufacturers accountable for producing computers with inferior
QWERTY layouts. He called it "Yes we can Dvorak".

## Next Nature
I've been on [Next Nature](http://nextnature.net) since maybe 2010.
It's crazy and wonderful.

I saw it in whats-his-name-from-Type-Camp's Tweet

## NICAR
I think it's fun because people ask basic questions that I can usefully
answer quickly.

Though it's annoying that people pile on with complicated answers long
after a question has been answered simply. I think people there get
excited when they know something and thus pile on with fancy-sounding
answers.

So NICAR's nice, but I try to avoid threads that have had much discussion
already.

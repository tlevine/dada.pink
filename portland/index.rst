On the naming of Portlands
=============================

Portland, Oregon is named after Portland, Maine.

    The later settlement of Portland started as a spot known as either
    "Stumptown" or "the clearing",[17] which was on the banks of the
    Willamette, located about halfway between Oregon City and Fort
    Vancouver. In 1843, William Overton saw great commercial potential for
    this land but lacked the funds required to file a land claim. He struck
    a bargain with his partner, Asa Lovejoy of Boston, Massachusetts: for
    25Â¢, Overton would share his claim to the 640-acre (2.6 km2) site.
    Overton later sold his half of the claim to Francis W. Pettygrove of
    Portland, Maine. Pettygrove and Lovejoy each wished to name the new city
    after his respective home town.

Portland, Maine is named after the Isle of Portland, Dorsetshire.

    In 1786, the citizens of Falmouth formed a separate town in Falmouth
    Neck and named it Portland, after the isle off the coast of Dorset,
    England.

I have yet to figure out when or how the Isle of Portland, Dorsetshire
was named. Here are some leads.

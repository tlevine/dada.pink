I like quiet places. Most American cities are too loud for me, but I have
discovered lower volumes in other countries, like most of Europe. I want a
job in a quieter place so I can move there. And I'm still available for
consulting anywhere in the short term.

## Education
Cornell University, Bachelor's of Science (May 2011, GPA 3.5)<br/>
Design & Environmental Analysis (Concentration in Human Factors & Ergonomics)

## Awards
* Hunter R. Rawlings III Cornell Presidential Research Scholar
* National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program, honorable mention

## Data science consulting
*(May 2011 to present)*

I help organizations take advantage of data. Services include

* Data strategy and architecture
* Data visualization
* Data warehousing, extract-transform-load (ETL), &c.
* Data gastronomification and other visualization-alternatives
* Design and development of end-user data analysis tools/apps
* Training on data science and software engineering

<!--
* Connecting disparate datasets of inconsistent data formats
-->

I'm usually happy to travel pretty much anywhere, and I'm also quite
good at collaborating remotely.

### Technology
I use a wide range of technologies as appropriate.
I am quite good with dynamic programming languages,
GNU/Linux system administration,
web development, relational databases, NoSQL databases,
data analysis software, &c.
In particular, I have about ten years of experience in
each of R, Python, and Shell.

I have a strong intuition for how large scales of data flow through computer
systems and people. I enjoy building robust systems to collect, process,
display, and analyze data in order to solve problems that people care about.

## Education
Cornell University, Bachelor's of Science (May 2011, GPA 3.5)<br/>
Design & Environmental Analysis (Concentration in Human Factors & Ergonomics)

## Awards
* Hunter R. Rawlings III Cornell Presidential Research Scholar
* National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program, honorable mention

## Data science consulting
*(May 2011 to present)*

I help organizations take advantage of data. Services include

* Data strategy and architecture
* Data visualization
* Data warehousing, extract-transform-load (ETL), &c.
* Data gastronomification and other visualization-alternatives
* Design and development of end-user data analysis tools/apps
* Training on data science and software engineering

### Technology
I use a wide range of technologies as appropriate.
I am quite good with dynamic programming languages,
GNU/Linux system administration,
web development, relational databases, NoSQL databases,
data analysis software, &c.
In particular, I have about ten years of experience in
each of R, Python, and Shell.

### Projects
Here are some projects I've done.

**Data integration**
dv01. New York, NY, USA. June 2015.
I am integrating data from assorted loan originators into a unified
analytics platform.

**Data management platform**.
New Orleans, Louisiana. May 2012 to present (two days per month).
I assist [Gulf Restoration Network](https://healthygulf.org/)'s
environmental advocacy efforts by developing and maintaining an
end-user system for gathering, refining, and integrating data on
wetlands in Louisiana.

**Anti-fraud**.
[World Bank](http://worldbank.org/), Integrity Vice Presidency.
Washington, DC, USA. June 2015.
I extended a system for data-driven detection of suspicious behaviors in
procurement processes based on new data.

**Process improvements for database reporting**.
New York, NY, USA. December 2014.
I build a language parser to programmatically analyze hundreds of database
reporting scripts for a healthcare firm and delivered an analysis of the
functions and relationships between different reporting scripts.

**Natural language processing**

I extracted structured information about legal briefs from unstructured
descriptions of legal briefs, to support legal research.

**Anti-fraud**.

## Notable software

### Rtreasuryio
Rtreasuryio is an R client library for downloading data from the treasury.io
data service and reifying them as data frames, R's standard representation of
data tables.

###
* `aamoer`: Format open data dumps for reporting.

### bashful-fs
`bashful-fs` is a low-level component of a the bashful interpreter.
The bashful interpreter is an implementation of the bash programming language
that can run inside of web browsers. `bashful-fs` implements a conventional
filesystem for, allowing for the manipulation of files inside of bashful.

### blizzard
Blizzard is a tool for surfacing similarities between disparate datasets.
It infers the data schemas of various datasets and constructs a similarity
graph between the datasets. This allows us to infer which datasets are
similar in structure to which other datasets.

### compress-opening-times
compress-opening-times is a specialized compression algorithm for data about
the opening times of brick-and-mortar businesses. It is implemented in
Javascript, so it can be used for compression of data inside of websites.

### cons.sql
`cons.sql` implements the linked list data structure in the PostgreSQL
database. This is a primitive language component that is necessary for
more certain algorithms.

### craigsgenerator
Craigsgenerator is a Python library for export data from Craigslist.
People use it to import data from Craigslist inside of Python programs.

### ddpy
ddpy is a tool for plotting big data in the form of music. It integrates
with pandas, a common tool for big data analysis. Its notable feature is
its user interface; it is essentially a music synthesizer with an
interface designed for data scientists.

### dicti
dicti is a customized version of Python's primitive dictionary data
structure. This data structure is a fundamental part of the language
that is often used to store text. In case in stores text, the text is
case-sensitive. In many instances, it is beneficial to have a
dictionary where the text is case-insensitive, and that is what dicti
provides.


### Dumptruck
DumpTruck is a document-like interface to a SQLite3 database, designed
to make it easy to use a SQLite3 from Python.

### geom\_döner
geom\_döner is a data gastronomification feature for the ggplot2
data-plotting framework. It allows for data to be plotted in the form
of döner kebabs, in addition to conventional visualizations, such as
scatterplots. It transforms the inputted data into orders that may be
presented to a fast-food restaurant.

### geom\_taco
geom\_döner is a data gastronomification feature for the ggplot2
data-plotting framework. It allows for data to be plotted in the form
of tacos, in addition to conventional visualizations, such as
scatterplots. It transforms the inputted data into simple orders that
may be presented to a taco truck.

### geom\_tacofancy
geom\_döner is a data gastronomification feature for the ggplot2
data-plotting framework. Like geom\_taco, it allows for data to be
plotted in the form of tacos, in addition to conventional
visualizations, such as scatterplots. The difference is that it
produces fancier tacos. It transforms the inputted data into full
recipes. Because of the wide possibilities in self-prepared tacos,
it supports very high data density.

### get-cached
get-cached is a tool for caching web pages and providing an audit
trail. It seamlessly makes GET requests in the hypertext transfer
protocol, saves the payload to your hard drive, and presents the payload
to the user. If it recognizes that the request has already been made,
it loads the data from the hard drive rather than making the request
again.

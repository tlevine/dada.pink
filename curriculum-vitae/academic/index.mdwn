I have a strong intuition for how large scales of data flow through computer
systems and people. I enjoy building robust systems to collect, process,
display, and analyse data in order to solve problems that people care about.

## Education
Cornell University, Bachelor's of Science (May 2011, GPA 3.5)<br/>
Design & Environmental Analysis (Concentration in Human Factors & Ergonomics)

## Awards
* Hunter R. Rawlings III Cornell Presidential Research Scholar
* National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program, honorable mention

## Data science consulting
*(May 2011 to present)*

I help organizations take advantage of data. Services include

* Data strategy and architecture
* Data visualization
* Data warehousing, extract-transform-load (ETL), &c.
* Data gastronomification and other visualization-alternatives
* Design and development of end-user data analysis tools/apps
* Training on data science and software engineering

### Technology
I use a wide range of technologies as appropriate.
I am quite good with dynamic programming languages,
GNU/Linux system administration,
web development, relational databases, NoSQL databases,
data analysis software, &c.
In particular, I have about ten years of experience in
each of R, Python, and Shell.

### Projects
Here are some projects I've done.

**Data management platform**.
New Orleans, Louisiana. May 2012 to present (two days per month).
I assist [Gulf Restoration Network](https://healthygulf.org/)'s

end-user system for gathering, refining, and integrating data on
wetlands in Louisiana.

**Data collection service**
February 2013 to December 2013.
As part of [csv soundsystem](http://csvsoundsystem.com),

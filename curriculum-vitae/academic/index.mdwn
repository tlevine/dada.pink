I have a strong intuition for how large scales of data flow through computer
systems and people. I enjoy building robust systems to collect, process,
display, and analyse data in order to solve problems that people care about.

## Education
Cornell University, Bachelor's of Science (May 2011, GPA 3.5)<br/>
Design & Environmental Analysis (Concentration in Human Factors & Ergonomics)

## Awards
* Hunter R. Rawlings III Cornell Presidential Research Scholar
* National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program, honorable mention

## Data science consulting
*(May 2011 to present)*

I help organizations take advantage of data. Services include

* Data strategy and architecture
* Data visualization
* Data warehousing, extract-transform-load (ETL), &c.
* Data gastronomification and other visualization-alternatives
* Design and development of end-user data analysis tools/apps
* Training on data science and software engineering

### Technology
I use a wide range of technologies as appropriate.
I am quite good with dynamic programming languages,
GNU/Linux system administration,
web development, relational databases, NoSQL databases,
data analysis software, &c.
In particular, I have about ten years of experience in
each of R, Python, and Shell.

### Projects
Here are some projects I've done.

**Data management platform**.
New Orleans, Louisiana. May 2012 to present (two days per month).
I assist [Gulf Restoration Network](https://healthygulf.org/)'s
environmental advocacy efforts by developing and maintaining an
end-user system for gathering, refining, and integrating data on
wetlands in Louisiana.

**Anti-fraud**.
[World Bank](http://worldbank.org/), Integrity Vice Presidency.
Washington, DC, USA. June 2015.
I extended a system for data-driven detection of suspicious behaviors in
procurement processes based on new data.

**Process improvements for database reporting**.
New York, NY, USA. December 2014.
I build a language parser to programmatically analyze hundreds of database
reporting scripts for a healthcare firm and delivered an analysis of the
functions and relationships between different reporting scripts.

**Natural language processing**
Los Angeles, CA, USA. May 2014.
I extracted structured information about legal briefs from unstructured
descriptions of legal briefs, to support legal research.

**Anti-fraud**.
[World Bank](http://worldbank.org/), Integrity Vice Presidency.
Washington, DC, USA. May 2014, June 2014.
I built a system for data-driven detection of suspicious behaviors in
procurement processes.

**Searching spreadsheets**.
[Ontodia](http://www.ontodia.com/).
New York, NY, USA. May 2014 to August 2014.
I prototyped specialized data search tools for Ontodia's
[Pediacities](http://nyc.pediacities.com/) data encyclopedia.

**Venture capital**.
[Vy Capital](http://vycapital.com/).
Menlo Park, CA, USA. February 2014 to April 2014.
I developed large-scale data acquisition systems to drive
investment decisions.

I did engineering and product management on [treasury.io](http://treasury.io)

**Data analysis software**.
[DataPad](http://datapad.io).
San Francisco, CA, USA. May 2013 to June 2013.
I did engineering on the data analysis product, mainly on the user
authentication module.

**Teaching**.
[Zipfian Academy](http://zipfianacademy.com).
San Francisco, CA, USA. August 2013 to November 2013.
I designed the data science curriculum and taught the first class of students.

**Microfinance investments**.
[Microfinance Information Exchange](http://mixmarket.org).
Washington, DC, USA. February 2012 to May 2012.
I mined the web for data to be used in an
[analysis](http://www.themix.org/publications/mix-microfinance-world/2012/05/mapping-financial-sector-south-africa)
of microfinance investment opportunities in South Africa.

**Software engineering**.

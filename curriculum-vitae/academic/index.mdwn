I have a strong intuition for how large scales of data flow through computer
systems and people. I enjoy building robust systems to collect, process,
display, and analyze data in order to solve problems that people care about.

## Education
Cornell University, Bachelor's of Science (May 2011, GPA 3.5)<br/>
Design & Environmental Analysis (Concentration in Human Factors & Ergonomics)

## Awards
* Hunter R. Rawlings III Cornell Presidential Research Scholar
* National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program, honorable mention

## Data science consulting
*(May 2011 to present)*

I help organizations take advantage of data. Services include

* Data strategy and architecture
* Data visualization
* Data warehousing, extract-transform-load (ETL), &c.
* Data gastronomification and other visualization-alternatives
* Design and development of end-user data analysis tools/apps
* Training on data science and software engineering

### Technology
I use a wide range of technologies as appropriate.
I am quite good with dynamic programming languages,
GNU/Linux system administration,
web development, relational databases, NoSQL databases,
data analysis software, &c.
In particular, I have about ten years of experience in
each of R, Python, and Shell.

### Projects
Here are some projects I've done.

**Data integration**
dv01. New York, NY, USA. June 2015.
I am integrating data from assorted loan originators into a unified
analytics platform.

**Data management platform**.
New Orleans, Louisiana. May 2012 to present (two days per month).
I assist [Gulf Restoration Network](https://healthygulf.org/)'s
environmental advocacy efforts by developing and maintaining an
end-user system for gathering, refining, and integrating data on
wetlands in Louisiana.

**Anti-fraud**.
[World Bank](http://worldbank.org/), Integrity Vice Presidency.
Washington, DC, USA. June 2015.
I extended a system for data-driven detection of suspicious behaviors in
procurement processes based on new data.

**Process improvements for database reporting**.
New York, NY, USA. December 2014.
I build a language parser to programmatically analyze hundreds of database
reporting scripts for a healthcare firm and delivered an analysis of the
functions and relationships between different reporting scripts.

**Natural language processing**
Los Angeles, CA, USA. May 2014.
I extracted structured information about legal briefs from unstructured
descriptions of legal briefs, to support legal research.

**Anti-fraud**.
[World Bank](http://worldbank.org/), Integrity Vice Presidency.
Washington, DC, USA. May 2014, June 2014.
I built a system for data-driven detection of suspicious behaviors in
procurement processes.

**Searching spreadsheets**.
[Ontodia](http://www.ontodia.com/).
New York, NY, USA. May 2014 to August 2014.
I prototyped specialized data search tools for Ontodia's
[Pediacities](http://nyc.pediacities.com/) data encyclopedia.

**Venture capital**.
[Vy Capital](http://vycapital.com/).
Menlo Park, CA, USA. February 2014 to April 2014.
I developed large-scale data acquisition systems to drive
investment decisions.

February 2013 to December 2013.
As part of [csv soundsystem](http://csvsoundsystem.com),
I did engineering and product management on [treasury.io](http://treasury.io)
We developed an end-to-end solution for journalists to access important
treasury data and use it in their reporting. The tool extracts and refines
the data from the official source, archives the data, exports the data to
a wide range of formats and data analysis tools. We also provide substantial
documentation on our technology and on the data themselves.

**Data analysis software**.
[DataPad](http://datapad.io).
San Francisco, CA, USA. May 2013 to June 2013.
I did engineering on the data analysis product, mainly on the user
authentication module.

**Teaching**.

I designed the data science curriculum and taught the first class of students.

**Microfinance investments**.
[Microfinance Information Exchange](http://mixmarket.org).
Washington, DC, USA. February 2012 to May 2012.
I mined the web for data to be used in an
[analysis](http://www.themix.org/publications/mix-microfinance-world/2012/05/mapping-financial-sector-south-africa)
of microfinance investment opportunities in South Africa.

**Software engineering**.
[ScraperWiki](https://scraperwiki.com).
Liverpool, UK. January 2012 to November 2012.
I worked on a new data processing
infrastructure and build specialized data processing systems

## Notable software libraries

### Rtreasuryio
Rtreasuryio is an R client library for downloading data from the treasury.io
data service and reifying them as data frames, R's standard representation of
data tables.

### aamoer
Aamoer is a framework for producing feature vectors to describe dataset-level
properties. One configures the features of interest, and aamoer produces a
full-featured, robust tool for the extraction of these features. Dataset-level
features are useful for comparisons between disparate datasets, for purposes
such as search and automated linking.

### bashful-fs
`bashful-fs` is a low-level component of a the bashful interpreter.
The bashful interpreter is an implementation of the bash programming language
that can run inside of web browsers. `bashful-fs` implements a conventional
filesystem for, allowing for the manipulation of files inside of bashful.

### blizzard

### geom\_tacofancy
geom\_döner is a data gastronomification feature for the ggplot2
data-plotting framework. Like geom\_taco, it allows for data to be
plotted in the form of tacos, in addition to conventional
visualizations, such as scatterplots. The difference is that it
produces fancier tacos. It transforms the inputted data into full
recipes. Because of the wide possibilities in self-prepared tacos,
it supports very high data density.

### get-cached
get-cached is a tool for caching web pages and providing an audit
trail. It seamlessly makes GET requests in the hypertext transfer
protocol, saves the payload to your hard drive, and presents the payload
to the user. If it recognizes that the request has already been made,
it loads the data from the hard drive rather than making the request
again.


### htmltable2matrix

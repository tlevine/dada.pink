# Easy Tom workshops
Sometimes I show up in a random hackerspace and people ask if I would
like to give a talk or class or something. I would, if people would like
to listen to it! So we just need to figure out which thing people would
like to listen to.

## General audiences
If you really have no particular idea of what people might like,
I recommend one of these.

* [Making personal websites](/!/making-your-personal-website/).
    I'll spend a few minutes with each attendee discussing what stuff
    they might want to put on the website and giving them a plan of
    how to go about it.
* [Real world algorithms](/!/real-world-algorithms/).
    We act out algorithms and data structures with people.

If people took statistics courses that they didn't understand, or even
if they did understand them, this one might work.

* [Statistics with doodles](/!/statistics-with-doodles-2014-03/).
    I explain elementary statistics better than the textbooks do.
    I accomplish this by geometrically compute elementary statistics,
    and I relate the geometric computations to the various written
    formulations.

If people want to learn to use computers, I suggest this one.

* [Switching to command line](/!/switching-to-command-line/).
    Do you want to use command lines more and window/buttons less?
    Let's write down some things that we do with graphical interfaces
    and then figure out how to do them with command line interfaces.
 
Other popular topics are on the ["recommended"](/recommended/) page.
These are appropriate if you know the audience will take interest in
vaguely that area. The main areas are

* Toilets
* Programming languages
  * R
  * Python
  * Shell
* Open openness
* Using music and food to plot data

I can also give bizarre life advice. Examples include

* [Carrying stuff in a backpack](/!/stuff/)
* [Career advice from Tom](/!/career-advice/)
* How to make yourself sound very competent, incompetant, successful,
    unsuccessful, happy, unhappy, &c.

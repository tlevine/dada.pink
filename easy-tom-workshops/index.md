# Easy Tom workshops
Sometimes I show up in a random hackerspace and people ask if I would
like to give a talk or class or something. I would, if people would like
to listen to it! So we just need to figure out which thing people would
like to listen to.

## General audiences
If you really have no particular idea of what people might like,
I recommend one of these.

* [Making personal websites](/!/making-your-personal-website/).
    I'll spend a few minutes with each attendee discussing what stuff
    they might want to put on the website and giving them a plan of
    how to go about it.
* [Real world algorithms](/!/real-world-algorithms/).
    We act out algorithms and data structures with people.
* *Data visualization needs to die: We need more dimensions!*
    I discuss my endeavour to use music and food to plot data.

I can also give bizarre life advice. Examples include

* [Carrying stuff in a backpack](/!/stuff/)
* How to make yourself sound very smart when the words you're
    saying are devoid of content
* [Career advice from Tom](/!/career-advice/)

### Vaguely specific audiences
I like drawing math. Do you like math? I'll have a fun time drawing
pretty much any math concept with shapes rather than with letters.
If people took statistics courses that they didn't understand, or even
if they did understand them, the first one might work. 

* [Statistics with doodles](/!/statistics-with-doodles-2014-03/).
    I explain elementary statistics better than the textbooks do.
    I accomplish this by geometrically compute elementary statistics,
    and I relate the geometric computations to the various written
    formulations.
* *Geometric versions of anything math*, like
    [means, medians, and modes](/!/higher-power-distance-measures/)
    (something to do with L<sup>p</sup> spaces).

If people want to learn to use computers, I suggest this one.

* [Switching to command line](/!/switching-to-command-line/).
    Do you want to use command lines more and window/buttons less?
    Let's write down some things that we do with graphical interfaces
    and then figure out how to do them with command line interfaces.

I can talk about concepts that are so basic that nobody writes documentation
about them, like these.

* [Protocols](/!/street-sign-protocol/)
* [Variables](/!/variables/)
* [Templating languages](/!/templating-languages/)

I also know a lot about toilets. 

* *Keeping bathrooms clean*. I'm quite interested in toilets;
    I'll review my various research on how people use toilets,
    mostly on people's judgement of
    [sanitation level](/!/risley-toilets/) and about the
    [postures that people use](/!/hovering-cycle/).
    I'll include several practical tips on keeping bathrooms clean
    that came out of my research.

### Specialized audiences
Other popular topics are on the ["recommended"](/recommended/) page.
These are appropriate if you know the audience will take interest in
vaguely that area. The main areas are

* Programming languages
  * R
  * Python
  * Shell
* [Open openness](/search/?q=open+data)
* Dada programs
  * Linked list in pgSQL
  * Test framework in shell
  * Music videos in R
* Ergonomics
* Typography
* Making simple data pipelines that

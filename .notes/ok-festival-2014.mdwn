## Session Title
Making a spreadsheet about spreadsheets:
What can we do when we look at thousands of spreadsheets at once?

## Session description
Now that we have tons of open data floating around, it's quite easy
to acquire many thousands of spreadsheets that you have never seen
before. What can we do with this?


## Session motivation
There are too many cool data to look at, and I want to look at them
all. But I also want to sleep. So I get computers to look at the data
for me. I've been studying this topic for
[about a year](http://thomaslevine.com/open-data) and would like to
get people thinking about the possibilities, get ideas from people,
and meet people who have similar interests.

## Session outcomes
Likely topics of brainstorming are

* How can we quantify how good or bad a spreadsheet is?
* How can we look for spreadsheets that are relevant to a particular thing?
* How can we deal with bad metadata? Can we infer metadata from similar
    spreadsheets?
* The way we publish data might affect how we use them. Can we test
    for effects of data publishing methods by looking at how thousands
    of differently published datasets are used?

Each group will write up the main points that they came up in the
brainstorming, and I'll photograph any diagrams that get made.
I'll distribute these recordings freely.

## How would the session be structured?
The session will start with a three-minute overview of Tom's work on
this topic to get people thinking.

Next, we'll break into groups of four to six people each, and groups
will brainstorm things that we can do by looking at lots of
spreadsheets at once. The duration of this section is flexible, but
25 minutes sounds good.

At the end of the session, each group will have two minutes to present
whatever it came up with.

In total, the session will last 35 minutes.

## How does your session contribute to OKFestivalâ€™s narrative and aims?
We'll brainstorm ways of unlocking the knowledge embedded
in hoards of disparate spreadsheets.

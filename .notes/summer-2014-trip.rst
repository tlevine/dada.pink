Notes for people I'm staying with
=====================================
Thanks for letting me stay with you! Here are some
things you might want to read.

Sleeping
~~~~~~~~~
I'm quite flexible as to where I sleep. For example,
here are some suitable places.

* In my own bed
* On the floor
* In a shared bed
* On the banister of a staircase

I'll need a blanket or radiator. I'm bringing soap and towel
and pillow, so I don't really need them. But they also can't hurt!

Washing
~~~~~~~~~
I'll be fine with my own laundry supplies, but the following
always makes things a bit easier.

* Laundry detergent (I'm carrying detergent for only about sixteen days of laundry.)
* Drying rack, fan, &c.
* A large tub/bowl

I'm bringing `three pairs of shirts </dada/stuff/>`_,
so I'm going to do laundry (usually in a sink or bucket)
at least every three days.

Not sleeping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If I'm snoring and that is keeping you up or otherwise bothering you,
wake me up, and I'll adjust pillows so I stop snoring. If you're too
shy to do that, find my `earmuffs`_ and wear them
to sleep.

Things
========
I want to give away `CSV files </dada/print-formaldehide>`_.
Remind me if I forget.

There are a few items that I wouldn't mind going shopping for.

* Custom ear plugs
* <del datetime="2014-07-01" cite="http://www.kinki.nl/kinki-locations2.php?city_id=11">A haircut</del>, and coloring of some of my hair <del datetime="2014-07-01" cite="https://twitter.com/Felienne/status/484789848985706496/photo/1">pink</del>
* A belt that doesn't dig into my skin
* <del datetime="2014-07-27" cite="https://www.facebook.com/zuzanna.klyszejko/posts/10152363694957971?comment_id=10152374460457971&offset=0&total_comments=5">A phone with service in Europe</del>

If I wind up getting ear plugs, I'm going to want to give my
`earmuffs`_.

Storage of important information
===================================
My passport is in my backpack. I'll take a picture and put it
somewhere on this site and link to it. I don't need a visa for
any of the countries I'm going to.

A summary of tickets for transportation things is in the
`travel section of my schedule </schedule/travel/>`_.
They are also in the "Notes" section of my email.

Addresses of places I'm staying are in the notes section of
my email. When I think people are okay with me putting it somewhere
public, these addresses will probably also wind up on this webpage
or in the aforemention travel schedule.

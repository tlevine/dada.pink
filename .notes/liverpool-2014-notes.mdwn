## Slavery
It's funny how the (Mersey?) Maritime Museum
devotes two floors to the tragic sinkings of
three luxury ocean liners and only one floor
to the collective tragedy of all enslavements
of all peoples throughout history.

## Hot air baloon drones
I went to the Liverpool drones group in DoES.
Quad-copters are expensive. I want to make a
remote-controlled hot air baloon instead.

## Imaginary line marker
There's a stone on the riverwalk that marks
the imaginary line specified in some law.
The description on the stone is particularly
opaquely verbose. I unfortunately didn't take
a picture, but it says that this stone was placed
here because of the act to mark the line, and
a few more words.

It could have just said "Port region ends here
(imaginary line from such act from 18whenever)."
Or maybe this was normal speak back then?

## Port blocking
How fun! The `_FreeWifi` network in Manchester airport
asks you fill out a form before you use the internet,
but it doesn't block the SSH or IMAP ports.

## Session Title
Assessing the assessor: Opacity of taxable property values

## Brief Abstract
My dad got excited about the recent
[revaluation of assessed values](http://transparencycamp.org/schedule/2014/talk-about-small-tools-related-to-open-data-stuff/edit/?2212b127479325cd58eb07702cf9a3c0890408d1)
in my home town. I want to talk to other people who know something about property tax valuations.
Some particular things I'm wondering about:

* Ways that governments assess property values
* Data I can get about property assessments
* New York State's RPS Version 4 FOIL Utility

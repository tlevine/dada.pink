There is (or was) a belly dancing group in Second Life that does
all the things that the belly dancing groups in the other life do!

> [I]n Second Life there was an active
> belly dance community which met in various locations
> within the world of Second Life during the week to watch
> each other dance (Poole, 28 January 2009).

[[!meta title="Staten Island Pizza"]]


Meet at the Staten Island
Ferry at 12 pm on whatever day we plan to do this on.

I want to visit two prestigious pizza establishments on Staten Island:
Joe & Pat's and Deninoâ€™s Pizzeria & Tavern. And I also like walking,
so we'll take a walk in between.

(I've recently become interested in pizza, and I'm working my
way through this list: http://thomaslevine.com/!/new-york-pizza)

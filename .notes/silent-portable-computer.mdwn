I want my desktop computer to be silent and easy-to-move.

I now have an [Asana something]()
with a solid-state drive. No moving parts, and quite portable.

The montior is a 27" LED monitor, which is quiet enough that I
don't notice it and quite easy to fit in a suitcase. I would like
to get replace this with something of similar scale that I can
fit in a backpack.

Put the projector far away

DPL uses a color wheel, and that makes noise.
Also, you need to filter the dust out of the air.

### I want LCD rather than DLP
LCD is sharper and uses less power.

### Specific models
P300 looked appealing, even after I saw this.

## My thinking
I'll get a good pico projector or mod an LCD projector.
Also, I can check whether my motherboard supports two monitors;
it has both an HDMI out and a DisplayPort out, so if it can do
both at the same time, I go for two low-resolution projectors,
and this might give more options.

## Session Title
Doing silly things with a million spreadsheets

## Brief Abstract
There are too many cool data to look at, and I want to look at them
all. But I also want to sleep, so I get computers to look at the data.
I've been downloading lots of "open data" (spreadsheets) and doing
[silly things](http://thomaslevine.com/open-data)
to them to figure out what they all are.
I want to talk about some of my findings, to hear about similar things
that other people are doing, and to get ideas of other things people can do.

Here are some particular things I'll mention.

* [Pluplusch](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pluplusch): Get spreadsheets from different places
* Statistics about spreadsheets
* Comparing features of different data catalog products
* Looking at server logs on data publisher websites
* [Comma search](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/commasearch): Search for spreadsheets based on spreadsheets

And maybe some related thoughts on open data things

* Unexcitement about data catalog softwares
* (Why) it's hard to find spreadsheets

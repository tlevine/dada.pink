## Talk title *
comma search, and Tomâ€™s views on searching across data tables

## Talk description (about a paragraph) *
I see two main issues in the common means of searching across data tables.
One issue is that the search is localized to datasets that are published
or otherwise managed by a particular entity, and another is that the search
mechanism doesn't use information relating to the tabular structure of
these data tables.

We can do better! Comma search indexes as many data tables as you want,
regardless of where they're from, and it uses the tabular structure of
these data tables to search for them. You provide a spreadsheet as input
and receive a list of spreadsheets in return. In this talk, you'll learn
how it works and how to use it.

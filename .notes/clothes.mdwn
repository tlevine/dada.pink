Before considering whether I like how clothes look,
I evaluate clothes with the following simple criteria.

General things
===================

## Material
The material should be warm, breathable, soft, &c., and this probably
means that it comes from an animal. Cashmere and silk are quite nice,
for example.

## Comfort
I prefer clothes that do not restrict my movement very much.
This includes things that are soft, stretchy, or loose-fitting.

## Color
Preferably, the color is either pink or black/gray/white. If it is not
among these, the color should still go with pink.

Type-specific preferences
===========================
Here are some criteria specific to clothing types.

## Shirt
My American shirt size is small. I usually wear size small, and I
rarely consider wearing size medium. I don't think I ever consider
shirts of other sizes.

Also, I wear only long-sleeved shirts, as I find them to be more
comfortable. They partly just feel nice, but the main thing is that
they keep my hands warmer.

## Pants
My pants size is 31.

## Shoes
My European shoe size is between 42 and 43. I don't know what the
American equivalent is.

## Jackets
Jackets take up a lot of space when they are folded up, so I am only
interested in them if they somehow don't take up very much space.
I like windbreakers, for example.

## Sweaters
Sweaters also take up a lot of space when they are folded up, so I
prefer to have several thin and warm sweaters.

That said, I might still use a big sweater that takes up a lot of
space as it can be nice to wear at home during winter.

## Socks
I would like to have at least three pairs of the same socks in order
not to need to sort them very much.

Current interests
===========================
I'm quite pleased with my present underwear, socks, hats, scarves,
jackets, and dress shirts. I'm looking mainly for shirts, light
sweaters, and pants that meet the above criteria.

Chords are daily movements (high/major = $$$ in, low/minor = $$$ out).

Flourishes represent movements up and down (respectively) within a two month
rolling window that are beyond 2.5 standard deviations from the mean.

The left channel is distance to debt ceiling (higher notes means closer to the
debt ceiling) and the right channel is interest rate.

Chernoff faces mutate according to 15 principal components of 52 different
categories of daily reciepts.

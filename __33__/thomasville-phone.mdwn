I finally came up a fun phone number! I looked for phone numbers that
would show up interestingly in the Caller ID. I first looked for places
called "[Thomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas#Places)" and didn't
find anywhere that looked big enough.

But then I tried "[Thomasville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomasville)"
and found three promising municipalities.

* [Thomasville, Alabama](http://www.thomasvilleal.com/), area code 334
* [Thomasville, Georgia](http://www.thomasvillega.com), area code 229
* [Thomasville, North Carolina](http://www.thomasville-nc.gov/), area code 336

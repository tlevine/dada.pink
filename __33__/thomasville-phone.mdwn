I finally came up a fun phone number! I looked for phone numbers that
would show up interestingly in the Caller ID. I first looked for places
called "[Thomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas#Places)" and didn't
find anywhere that looked big enough.

Then, at Wikipedia's suggestion,
I tried "[Thomasville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomasville)"
and found three promising municipalities.

* [Thomasville, Alabama](http://www.thomasvilleal.com/), area code
    [334](https://www.voip.ms/m/orderdid.php?type=starts&query=334&state=AL&action=didsearch)
* [Thomasville, Georgia](http://www.thomasvillega.com), area code
    [229](https://www.voip.ms/m/orderdid.php?type=starts&query=229&state=GA&action=didsearch)
* [Thomasville, North Carolina](http://www.thomasville-nc.gov/), area code
    [336](https://www.voip.ms/m/orderdid.php?type=starts&query=336&state=NC&action=didsearch)

Which of these do I want!? I eventually decided on Thomasville, Georgia,
for a few reasons.

* Thomasville, Alabama and Thomasville, North Carolina distinguish
    themselves by their commerce, whereas Thomasville, Georgia
    talks about
    [lots of other things](http://www.thomasvillega.com/Content/Default/8/18/0/thomasville-visitor%27s-center/living-here.html);
    I suspect that I would find Thomasville, Georgia to be the most
    pleasant of the three.
* I kind of liked the "22" rather than the "33".
* Most importantly, Thomasville, Georgia is in Thomas county.

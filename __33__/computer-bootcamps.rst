You may have heard of computer "bootcamps", informal schools that are
structured a bit like university semesters or like continuing education
courses and that teach computer stuff, probably a bit better than universities
do. Perhaps you're even considering taking one! But they're a lot of work
and money, and the application process might be annoying, and you may worry
that your present knowledge is too little. I hope the present writing will
resolve some of your wonderings.

Reasons to take a bootcamp course
-----------------------------
I find that people take bootcamps for these reasons.

1. They feel like they need to be doing a thing with a name, rather than
   fiddling around on their computers at home.
2. They want to be stressed-out.
3. They want to feel like they are working towards finding a job.
4. They want someone to choose the curriculum for them and to believe that
   the curriculum is a good one.
5. They want to be around other people who are learning computers with them.
6. They want to talk periodically with people who know more about the thing
   they're learning.

Most bootcamps provide all of these, though people usually talk about the
last four and not the first two.

If you want most of these, you'll probably enjoy a bootcamp.

Alternatives
-----------------------------
Here are some alternatives that fulfill only some of the above six
`reasons to take a bootcamp course <#reasonstotakeabootcampcourse>`_.

The main reason to do one of the alternatives below

`Tom School </!/tom-computer-school/>`_ fulfills the last three
and not the first three.

If you need all but number 1, just fiddle around at home like you have been doing.
If you only need number 3, read Career Advice from Tom (http://thomaslevine.com/!/career-advice/) instead.
If you need anything other than 2 or 3, do Tom School. (It doesn't have to involve me specifically, of course.)
If you need only number 5, go to an appropriate hackerspace. (I can suggest some.)

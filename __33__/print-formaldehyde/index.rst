The table is also shown below in digital form.

    carb,optden
    0.1,0.086
    0.3,0.269
    0.5,0.446
    0.6,0.538
    0.7,0.625
    0.9,0.782

The dataset is derived from the
`Formaldehyde <http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/Formaldehyde.html>`_
dataset from base R, but a "6" was swapped for the highlighted "5"
because I ran out of 6s; in the original dataset, the fifth value
of "optden" is 0.62**6** instead of 0.625.

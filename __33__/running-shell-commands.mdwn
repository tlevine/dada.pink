Perhaps you are writing a program in one language and then want to
call something that is written in another language. One way of doing
this is to run a shell command. Here are ways of running shell commands
in many different languages.

## C#
Here's the simple way.

    string strCmdText;
    strCmdText= "/C copy /b Image1.jpg + Archive.rar Image2.jpg";
    System.Diagnostics.Process.Start("CMD.exe",strCmdText);

Do this to hide the cmd window.

    System.Diagnostics.Process process = new System.Diagnostics.Process();
    System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo startInfo = new System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo();
    startInfo.WindowStyle = System.Diagnostics.ProcessWindowStyle.Hidden;
    startInfo.FileName = "cmd.exe";

    // "/C" runs and then exits without waiting for user input.
    startInfo.Arguments = "/C copy /b Image1.jpg + Archive.rar Image2.jpg";

    process.StartInfo = startInfo;
    process.Start();

    // Wait for the process to end before continuing with the program.
    process.WaitForExit()

(I got these from [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1469764/run-command-prompt-commands).)

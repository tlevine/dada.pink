## Abstract
Sometimes people act really mean for no apparent reason. Other times they
say stuff that suggests one thing and do stuff that suggests another thing,
and this can seem cold, rude, &c.

I get very confused and frustrated when this happens; why would someone ever
do this? Did I do something wrong? I can hide my frustration by saying that
the person is just fundamentally bad, that leads to other unpleasant things
because this is never the real reason.

It turns out that there usually is a simple explanation that doesn't require
me to hate the person; in the present piece, I'll show you how I come up with
these explanations.

My method can help you to understand people (including yourself),
to recognize mindgames, and to be direct in communication. Moreover,
I hope that it helps you empathise with people who are being mean,
stressful, cold, indirect, or rude.

## Definition
I usually use the word "silly" to describe the collection of
mean, manipulative, cold, deceptive, rude, angry, &c. that I'm discussing.

I think that the phenomenon, at its core, involves a person who is lying
to himself or herself and is upsetting another person in the process.

## Why I write this
I am usually quite interested by why anyone acts the way she or he does.
I thought to write this piece after learning from
[Matt Linares](http://matt.microsplash.org/) about
[neuro-linguistic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming).
I remarked that I pay attention to the
same sorts of things (without having a name for them) but with the
slightly different focus discussed above: Rather than avoiding being
manipulated, I am interested in understanding why someone would do
something so bizarre.

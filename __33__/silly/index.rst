Do you want to use command lines more and window/buttons less?
Let's write down some things that we do with graphical interfaces
and then figure out how to do them with command line interfaces.
And then we can write directions so that we can look up how to do
these things when we forget (and also so other people can read them).
Note: this started during Wikipedia Weekend in Tirana 2014 (http://openlabs.cc/si-te-perdorim-command-line/), where Redon became curious about how it could be using his computer only using command line. So they agreed to host a workshop and invite people that might be interested on something like this. Orven, Elio, Ilda and Greta showed up to the workshop. 
Things also progressed when Besfort organized the same workshop in Prishtina.  

Graphical programs that Redon uses and some suggested CLI equivalents

Thunderbird
    Setting up mutt and everything would be a bit of work, but maybe just a search thing, for example, could help.
Banshee
    I use `mplayer <mplayer>`_ for music.
LibreOffice
    Depending on what he's doing, LaTeX or other text files or maybe a markdown to pdf thing
Transmission
    I still use the GUI for this. (And I use either Transmission or Deluge.)
Screenshots
    This is the easiest one! It's called `import <import>`_, and it's in imagemagick.
Calculator
    Any interpreted language would be great. More `here <calculator>`_

The command line is better, but it takes a while to learn, so Tom
uses the graphical interfaces until he learns the command line.

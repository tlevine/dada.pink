Until recently, all of the stuff I took with me when I moved house
fit in this backpack.




I recently got a bicycle, and the bicycle unfortunately doesn't fit
in the backpack.

![(I'll put a picture here eventually.)]()

On the other hand, I have lots of storage space on my bicycle.

* Two pannier bags on the front wheel
* Two pannier bags on the back wheel
* Room on the front wheel and handlebars for a big bag
* Room on top of the back rack and panniers for a big bag
* Room on my body for a backpack and frontpack.
* A frame bag

At the moment, all bags are empty except the two front pannier bags.
These front pannier bags are about two-thirds full. Here's what's in
them.

* Everything that had been in my aforementioned backpack
* Bike tools
* An empty backpack, an empty frontpack, and a few empty stuff sacks

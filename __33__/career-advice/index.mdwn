[[!meta title="Career advice from Tom"]]

*These started as notes for a talk at [Cyber Wizard Institute](http://cyber.wizard.institute/). A video might come eventually.*

Perhaps you are considering a career, maybe in "data science",
maybe in some other form of cyber wizardry, or maybe something
totally different. And perhaps you are wondering what you should
learn, how to get a job, how to market yourself, &c. I have assembled
some advice for you!

## Why do you want a job?
There are all kinds of reasons why the career that interests you would
appeal to you. The nominal reason is often that you want to be able to
afford to live, or at least pay off your student debt. But there are so
many more motivations behind career choices!

You might be looking for a purpose, a way to contribute to the world.
Or you might not care so much about such a purpose and care more about
meeting friends. Or even future mates! Maybe you want to make lots of
money, not just enough to survive, but enough to afford fancy cars and
limousines. Maybe you want to make your parents proud. Or maybe you
actually like doing the thing.

If I were sitting right next to you, we could try to pick apart why
you are interested in this career, and then I might give you advice
that is more specific.

Since you're not sitting next to me, I'm not going to do that now,
but I here are three things to consider.
First, anything that motivates you towards a particular career is real
and totally valid, even if it sounds very unprofessional or childish.
Second, a job probably isn't the only way to accomplish those
things you might want out of job.
Third, it is possible that you have found something that you like doing
but need some special status, position, institutional affiliation, &c.
in order to do; in this case, you should question whether you actually
like doing the thing and whether you really need the special status,
as you might be wrong about one of these two things.

## How to make money
As I indicated above, I think that making money is pretty much the only
good reason to take your career seriously. The other things that people
supposedly get out of a job are way easier to accomplish elsewhere.
If you want a purpose in your life, start doing something that's actually
worthwhile. If you want to meet friends, find fun things to do all day.
And if you want to pay back your student debt,
[don't pay back your debt](http://strikedebt.org/drom/).

Here are some things that took me way too long to learn and might apply
to you if you care at all about making money.

### Pretending
In the real world, everyone is pretending that she or he belongs there and
that she or he knows what she or he is doing. This should explain why everyone
seems to like his or her job and to be making more money than you.

Also, since most people are lying, they probably won't call you out on any lies
that you make; calling you out on your lie will remind them that they are lying,
and they don't like being reminded of that.

I'm told that this is how letters of recommendations work.

### It is okay to produce bad work
I often hear of people trying hard to do good work inside of an organization
that doesn't appreciate their work or makes their good work hard. A clich√©
example is designers who advocate for their users so that the resulting product
is useful but repeatedly get shut down by their managers who think they know
better.

*Why do you care!?* If you have to fight with your manager to do good work,
all of your colleagues probably do too, and that's a lot of fighting. If you
really want to do good work, find another place to work.

I find it much easier to run away from conflict. I would make only light
suggestions, avoid getting very stressed out about the mismanagement, and
make some money. If you really care about doing good design or whatever,
you can quit your job to do that and live off the money you saved while working.

### Be insulted when you are paid anything less than ridiculous wages
My wages have so much less to do with the work I provide than I had
innocently hoped they would. If you decide that your normal rate is
$10,000 per hour and that anything less than $7,000 per hour is absolutely
insulting, then that suddenly becomes reasonable. Okay, maybe it shouldn't
be *that* outrageous.

This gets back to the point about pretending. People don't really know
what a reasonable salary is, so if you act like something ridiculous is
totally reasonable, nobody's going to call you out on it.
Especially in startups.

### Try to work just enough not to get fired and no more
This is an extension of the previous one, and it is especially relevant
when your pay is based on time you worked rather than on the completion
of a project.

I think that working "hard" is more about creating a feeling of comradery,
where a group of colleagues are making sacrifices towards a greater goal;
it doesn't usually change how much is accomplished, and if it does, the
change is usually that less being accomplished.

Even if working harder does improve how much is accomplished, you are
unlikely to be appropriately rewarded for it. Your pay is based on what
seems like a normal amount to pay someone, rather than on what work you
did for the people.

### Profit and greed are the least of motivations in business
People sometimes say that God says that we shouldn't kill each
other and still decide to go to Israel to fight a holy war. Similarly,
people sometimes say that they are in the business of making money and
then hire hip rockstar programmers so they can feel cool.

The typical examples of this is that people put
[women](http://www.newsweek.com/2015/02/06/what-silicon-valley-thinks-women-302821.html),
certain ethnic groups,
and old people
in positions where they'll be less productive. (They often get different jobs,
lower pay rates, or don't get hired at all.) If business were all about
short-sighted money profit, this stuff would happen much less.

These typical examples just scratch the surface.

Here's a more nuanced non-profit phenomenon.
I think that much of "data science" is people with advanced degrees who
didn't find jobs in academia but want to feel like they're still doing
"research". It can be really fun to use the fancy stuff that you read in a
paper, but I very rarely manage to find situations where any of the fancy
things I read in fancy books and journals is practical; I think that people
say they need their analysis, science, &c. skills because they want to feel
like researchers, not because it is particularly helpful for the business.

If people actually wanted to make money, things would work a lot differently.

### Do real work for short terms rather than trying to find something that you enjoy and still pays
I periodically consider going to graduate school. I still haven't gone, and
here is much of the reason.

I could join the academy, spend half of my time doing grant-funded research,
spend half my time teaching, and spend the third half of my time applying for
grants. Or, I could do whatever I want most days ("research"), work for a few
weeks a year at real jobs, and sleep the rest of the time.

### Don't apply for jobs.
Some people like to say that you should apply to things even if you don't
think you'll get them because "you miss all the shots you don't take".
This advice is horribly misguided, as you will also miss all of the shots
that you do take.

This advice ignores that applying to things is a lot of work and that it
rarely leads to anything; if you actually want a job, there are far better
things that you could do. In fact, I think that you're better off
[sleeping](/!/sleeping/) rather than applying for jobs if your goal is to
get a job.

Applications are very noisy processes with very little feedback.
They involve a lot of work from the applicant, and it's practically
impossible to figure out how to make an application good. And if the
organization actually wants to hire someone, application processes are
even more work on their end.

Since application processes are so financially wasteful for all involved
parties (not just the applicant) why would companies engage in such a
wasteful activity? It's because, as I said before,
[money isn't everything](#profitandgreedaretheleastofmotivationsinbusiness).
Nominally, the goal of the job application is to select good candidates
for a role that they need to fill in order to make more money,
or something like that. Here are some
other reasons that a company might ask for job applications.

1. People in the organization want to feel like they are smart. Interviewing
    people makes them feel smart, and being very selective makes them feel
    smarter. Also, the people who get selected feel smart.
2. People really started the company because they want to make friends, not
    because they want to make money.
3. People in organization don't really know what they want and are deferring
    their decision until later. I think this is more common with grants and
    short projects than with jobs.
4. People in the organization are [pretending](#pretending)
    that they know what they're doing, so they post jobs just like all the
    other companies do.
5. People with the commitment to jump through all the application hoops
    are likely to have the commitment to stay at the job once they get it
    and to work hard. Moreover, this has to do with a culture of hard
    work and sacrifice at the company.

It's not any one of these is the only reason in any case, of course.
Lots of things are going on, and making money is only one of the concerns.

### If you do apply for a job, spend as little time as you possibly can on the application.
Sometimes even I convince myself that it's worth applying for things. In such
cases, I rush through application materials as fast as I possibly can; I get
annoyed with myself when I spend more than a few minutes on an initial application
form. Here are some things I do in order to avoid spending time writing the application.

* Be what the people are looking for; don't try to tell the truth or to be
    yourself.
* Probably use lots of buzzwords.
* Reuse things you have written elsewhere.
* In the rare case that you think an application deserves more than three
    minutes of work, don't change your other plans because of application
    deadlines; just don't apply.
* Don't proofread.

I'm fine with a couple hours of talking to people, but if I find myself
unclear as to how drawn-out the process of interviewing or otherwise talking to
people is going to be, I'll probably withdraw my application.

Still, remember the advice I just told you: **Don't apply for jobs**! While you
can make applications less wasteful by spending less time on them, they are still
pointless most of the time.

For example, it might be worth applying to a company if
know someone in the company and basically have the job
but need to apply as a formality. This has a slight chance of working, but even
then, it's hit-or-miss; the policies of the organization that you are applying
to are likely to be complicated enough that your contact doesn't fully
understand the policies.

<!--
One of the times I applied for graduate school, my
would-be advisor realized only after I had been accepted that funding for me
wouldn't be enough because I wasn't an European citizen. There are too many little
things like this that take way too long to learn when application processes are
so long.

### The main reason you need "experience" is so you can feel confident when you're bullshitting.
I remarked when I had just graduated from college that people were treating
me like a "recent graduate" who didn't know anything. I think that if I had
just hung out on the beach for a few years and not touched a computer that
people would think that I had some "experience". Or I could have just lied
about my age.

But there is, in fact, more to bullshitting than fitting your background into
a mold. Even if you think that you don't know anything or that you're slow at
computers, you could probably learn everything that you needed to do for lots
of entry-level programming work on the job. The issue is that you have to
convince the company that you know the appropriate amount of each of the
buzzwords and incoherently fancy language.

#### Some examples of bullshit

I haven't figured out exactly how this bullshit works, but here are some things
that come to mind.

Develop arbitrary preferences. For example, learn to explain
why a particular software is best and to complain about all of the problems
about all of the alternatives. There is a diversity of experiences in the human
condition, so most of these softwares are probably just fine, but briefly
suspend this reasonability while you act like you're all experienced and shit.

Act smart in meetings.
[This guide](https://medium.com/conquering-corporate-america/10-tricks-to-appear-smart-during-meetings-27b489a39d1a) is pretty good.

### Work only if it pays well.
My view is that it is best to do horrible work for brief periods and then to
spend most of your time [sleeping](/!/sleeping) and otherwise having fun.

I haven't actually used most of the above advice to get jobs; a lot of it is
outrageous stuff that I think would work but haven't really tried. Some of
the reason that I haven't tried it is because I haven't been working very
long, but much of it is that I feel horrible about deceiving people, even if
it is the only way to make money.

I want to retire so I'm happy to do horrible work if it pays ridiculously
well. But I don't want to do not-horrible work that pays okay, because I'd
rather just sleep.

### Treat your career like a game, and have fun with it
I think I enjoy working in stuffy companies because I like to see why people
act the way they do. I think it's hilarious that the real world is just as
arbitrary as they say it is in the movies.

I always find it absolutely bizarre that someone would want to start a company.
Here are some explanations I have come up with.

* One person wanted to do the work that his parents did.
* Another person wanted to meet rock stars and programmers.
* A higher-up in one company was used to corporate sales and kept doing that
    because she needed something to do all day, even though the company didn't
    have much to sell.
* One person wanted to go traveling, but he lives in San Francisco, so
    he started a backpack company instead.

### Practice pretending
I make a game out of [pretending](#pretending) to be the superunicorn that
everybody wants.

If you want some practice in pretending, fill your LinkedIn profile with
buzzwords and respond to the recruiters. Or, even easier, just ask me to refer
one of them to you, and you can try to keep up the act.

## Why Tom's career advice may be totally irrelevant
The stuff I say above makes perfect sense to me, but other people think
it wouldn't apply to them. I think this is the bigger message you should
take from the present writing.

### Different backgrounds
People grew up in all different places, learned different things when they
were young, had different relationships with their families and other people,
have different genes, and so on. It's quite likely that the person giving
you advice was different enough that what he or she did won't always work for
you; moreover, it's not like we can know whether the advice will apply.

For example, some people are especially interested in making money. I find
that these people often came from relatively poor families and are hoping to
provide for their parents or for their (future) children.

### Discrimination
Many people say that my career advice above applies only to people of
very priviliged backgrounds and that it won't work if you are
discriminated against.

### Career motivations change throughout life
Even a single person will have totally different career motivations throughout
her or his (or zir) life.

Various fancy people came up with ideas as to what motivates people. Here are
some of them

* [Two-factor theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_theory)
* [Erikson's stages of psychosocial development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erikson%27s_stages_of_psychosocial_development)
* [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs)
* [Behaviorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviorism)
* [Ecological systems theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_systems_theory)

I particularly like a way of thinking that we attribute to Erik Erikson,
mainly because his name is "Erik Erikson". His father left when he was
young, so he changed his name from "Erik [whatever-his-father's-last-name-was]"
to "Erik Erikson". But they're all good.

The point here is that your motivation will change throughout life, so you
can't even expect someone of a very similar background to give you relevant
advice.

### Why people give advice
Lots of people have no idea how to do what they want to do and want to
feel like they do know what they are doing. Giving advice can reassure
yourself that you are doing something reasonable. For example, if you
think that you should sleep a lot, you might suggest that other people
learn sleep a lot, in order to convince yourself that sleeping really
is a good idea.

Similarly, people often give advice in order to convince themselves that
they are experts. For example, you might give people career advice in
order to convince yourself that you know a lot about career stuff.

I quite enjoy saying outrageous things as if they're totally normal and
am also rather frustrated by how much of the advice I have been given is
totally irrelevant. My career advice [above](#tomscareeradvice) can be
summarized as "Tom used to believe common wisdoms, so he is surprised,
frustrated, and amused when he finds that they are totally wrong.
He also likes being outrageous."

There are so many other reasons why people would give advice; my point
is that helping you out is the least of the reasons.
If someone is giving me advice, I usually see the advice as advice that
the other person is giving himself or herself (or zirself) rather than as
something that has anything to do with me.

### The blind lead the blind
I'm only 24 years old and have been out of college for only three-and-a-half
years (as of January 2015), so it is absolutely hilarious that people think
I actually know anything about anything. On the other hand, it's not like I'll
have much better of an idea when I'm 30; there is a diversity of experiences
in the human condition, and everyone has been exposed to only a tiny portion
of them.

## Reasons not to get irrelevant advice
[According to Magda Zena](http://magdazena.com/good-and-bad-advice-how-to-see-a-difference/),
bad stuff might happen to you if you receive advice that you didn't
want; aside from following the irrelevant advice, you might develop
[reactance](http://www.psychwiki.com/wiki/Reactance_Theory).

## Conclusion
We might thusly summarize everything I just said.

1. Tom does whatever he feels like doing, tells people about it, and
    magically gets paid once in a while.
2. Tom thinks everyone should do this too, except that he doesn't,
    because he knows it's outrageous
3. Moreover, Tom thinks everyone else's advice is just as outrageous
    as his own and that advice is only rarely worth following.

I enjoy how my career advice is completely reasonable in my mind while
totally outrageous in everyone else's. It makes perfect sense for me
but probably not for you.

Lots of people give career advice, and while it isn't as outrageous as
mine, I doubt it is any more reasonable.
People have all different reasons why they work, and people come from
all different backgrounds, so it is quite likely that well meant advice
won't apply at all to you.

I think I'm starting to get something about Haskell.

The dynamic (R, Python, JavaScript, &c.) way is to build libraries that
provide very simple structures as output and thus make few assumptions
about type. This allows us to postpone dealing with types.

The static (Haskell, &c.) is to import things right away with strong types
and to build generic libraries that might require some configuration but
can be connected to complex types.

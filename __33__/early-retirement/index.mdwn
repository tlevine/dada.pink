One Monday morning, [Matt](), [Marina](), [James](), and I
were hanging out at Matt's house. Matt's roommates were also
around, and one of them remarked that it was odd that we were
all at home rather than at work.

"Are you striking because BART isn't?", she asked.

workers had been considering a strike, so this was a joke.
But I decided then that we were indeed on strike, against
boring and exploitative work. Matt had just left his job,
Marina was working full-time (I think.) but not from a
particular office, James has never had a real job, and I
was working part-time.

I also decided that I (and probably we all) was retired.
I didn't have enough money saved up that I could live off
it for the rest of my life, but my situation was such that
I could probably do whatever I wanted for the rest of my
life and that money wouldn't be hard to find.

The above anecdote was from October 2013. I now feel
qualified to say that I'm retired.

## Expenses
I've rarely ever thought much about what I spend, but it
always seems to be much lower than that of other people.
A high estimate of my yearly expenses is $20,000, most of
which is for housing.

## Assets
My parents saved money for me to go to college, and I only
spent half of that. I'd rather not put the remaining money
to ordinary living expenses, but I'm comfortable putting it
towards schooling for a child, should I have one. If we assume
an inflation-adjusted interest rate of 5% per year, this money
will triple in 25 years, so it should be more than enough to
put someone through college.

I've also been making money myself. About $XXX of my savings
can be attributed to my own earnings, and I'm presently making
$XXX.

## What to do with the money I can't spend
I want to give grants of the following format.

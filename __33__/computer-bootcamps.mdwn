You may have heard of computer "bootcamps", informal schools that are
structured a bit like university semesters or like continuing education
courses and that teach computer stuff, probably a bit better than universities
do. Perhaps you're even considering taking one!

But they're a lot of work
and money, and the application process might be annoying, and you may worry
that your present knowledge is too little. Or, you might not know which one
to take. I hope the present writing will resolve some of your wonderings.

Reasons to take a bootcamp course
-----------------------------
I find that people take bootcamps for these reasons.

1. They feel like they need to be doing a thing with a name, rather than
    fiddling around on their computers at home.
2. They want to be stressed-out.
3. They want to feel like they are working towards finding a job.
4. They want someone to choose the curriculum for them and to believe that
    the curriculum is a good one.
5. They want to be around other people who are learning computers with them.
6. They want to talk periodically with people who know more about the thing
   they're learning.

Most bootcamps provide all of these, though people usually talk about the
last four and not the first two.

If you want most of these, you'll probably enjoy a bootcamp.

## Worries
Here I address some specific worries.

### Will I be able to I handle the workload?
"Handle" could mean a lot of things. 

Yes, but you might not like it.
You might consider [alternatives](#alternatives>) with lighter workloads.


Will I get in?

Is it worth the money?
    No, not even if it gets you a job. I'm dead serious.

Alternatives
-----------------------------
Here are some alternatives that fulfill only some of the above six
[reasons to take a bootcamp course](#reasonstotakeabootcampcourse)

The main reason to do one of the alternatives below

[Tom School](/!/tom-computer-school/>) fulfills the last three
and not the first three.

If you need all but number 1, just fiddle around at home like you have been doing.
If you only need number 3, read Career Advice from Tom (http://thomaslevine.com/!/career-advice/) instead.
If you need anything other than 2 or 3, do Tom School. (It doesn't have to involve me specifically, of course.)
If you need only number 5, go to an appropriate hackerspace. (I can suggest some.)

## Bootcamp business models
The business model of a specific bootcamp is related to many of the things
I discussed above.

I think of three categories of business model for these bootcamps.
(It's not like one bootcamp follows only one model, of course.)

The most straightforward thing would be a course with high **tuition**
and has no other revenue source. I get the sense that this is how weekly
courses usually work; you pay $4,000 for 15 weeks or so, just like a
university course. Many three-month courses do cost quite a bit of money
too, though tuition is usually not their *only* source of income.

Most of the three-month courses make money by **referring students to jobs**,
even if they do charge tuition of their students. I get the sense that
this works the same as with other recruiters. And I don't really know how
recruiting works, but I think recruiters tend to get about one-fifth of
a yearly salary for each referral who sticks around long enough.

Some bootcamps charge no tuition at all and make their money from
recruiting. Some bootcamps even pay their students to attend the school.

Many three-month courses combine the referrals with the tuition and pass
some of their referral fee along to the students; they might charge $16,000
tuition for three months, with a $4,000 discount if the student takes a job
from a company that pays the school for the referral.

Some **universities** offer things that could be called "bootcamps" but
aren't. These are instead called "masters" programs or just normal courses
and differ from typical university offerings in they are taught by normal
academic credentials. The ways that universities make money are complicated
enough that I don't really try to understand them.

My desk will be a table top
with stubs onto which disposible legs can be attached.

## Table
The table top is made of
[tempered hardboard](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Unbranded-3-16-in-x-48-in-x-96-in-Tempered-Hard-Board-832780/202404545),
and it is sized in order that it just fits in my
[artist portfolio](/!/artist-portfolio).

The stubs for legs are square-prism blocks of wood glued to the
table top, with holes drilled through the blocks.

The legs are cardboard tubes. I can easily acquire these anywhere
I'm going to go.

To assemble the desk, I poke holes in the cardboard tubes, slide
them over the stubs, and put some string or a dowel or screw or something
through the holes to fix them in place.

## Chair
The chair is the [BackJack](http://www.bjindustriesinc.com/backjack-chairs.htm),
either the original or the folding but not the XL. Either of these models will
fit in the backpack.

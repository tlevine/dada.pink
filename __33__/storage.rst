[[!meta title="Storage services"]]

Here are some attributes of different services. The more appealing services
are earlier in the table.

====================== ================ ========== =============== ==============================

MakeSpace_             Drop-off/pick-up USA (UPS)  $25 for 4 boxes $20 per box
Storrage_              Drop-off/pick-up Seattle    $4 per box      $7 per drop-off/pick-up

ManhattanMiniStorage_  Storage unit     NY         $40             Receive packages for free
====================== ================ ========== =============== ==============================

For storage unit services, the costs are approximate and for the smallest units.
For drop-off/pickup services with many plans, the costs are for the one I am most
likely to use. In both cases, the price is the monthly cost.

Box Sizes
-------------
Conventional storage units get as small as a 3.5' cube, but you are more likely
to find a 5' cube.

Storrage, and BoxBee box sizes are, respectively,
`24" × 20" × 12" <http://www.storrage.com/questions.html>`_,
and `24" × 19" × 12.5" <https://boxbee.com/assets/static/images/Pricing-02.png>`_.
I couldn't figure out the exact size for MakeSpace boxes. Boxes of this size
can be shipped by USPS Priority Mail (to and from StorageByMail) for $25 or
less, which is effectively free when you account for the USPS free shipping
scheme. USPS quickly gets more expensive after this size.

More on boxes
------------------
I checked Sarah's Storrage boxes and found the model number "CFP-261".
Searching around, I found the similarly named and specified
`Orbis FP 261 <http://www.orbiscorporation.com/Products/Hand-Held-Containers/Stack-N-Nest/FP261#.VJ1wOTC_ALU>`_.
The cheapest price I can find for it is $20, which is even more than Storrage
charges. So I searched around for similar boxes and found some neat and cheaper things.

The Akro Grid containers look pretty cool. But expensive.
How about this?

* AK-33221 Clear Plastic Covers for Akro Grid Containers
* AK-42228 Long Dividers for Akro Grid Containers
* AK-41228 Short Dividers for Akro Grid Containers
* And maybe some AK-39120-G Gray Attached Lid Containers

And I enjoy that there's a
`Plastic Shipping Container Institute <http://www.pscionline.org/>`_.

Mail
---------
All of these services are interesting in relation to mail.

StorageByMail and MakeSpace (outside of New York) use ordinary shipping
services (USPS and UPS, respectively) for pickup and delivery. As far as
I can tell, they will only receive scheduled pickups; I can't buy something
on the internet and have it mailed there.

Storrage, MakeSpace in New York, and BoxBee do their own pick-ups and drop-offs.
None of these receives packages, but BoxBee will ship packages between their
different cities.

I read about a
"`CubeSmart Direct <http://blog.selfstorage.com/self-storage-reits/cubesmart-direct-3496>`_"
with characteristics similar to Storrage and BoxBee, but I found nothing about it on
CubeSmart's website.

ManhattanMiniStorage and CubeSmart both receive packages. CubeSmart is neat in
that they'll put the packages into your storage unit! I think.

Other things
----------------
MakeSpace, Storrage, and BoxBee look very startuppy. CubeSmart and
ManhattanMiniStorage look very established well-marketed. StorageByMail
is more low-key.

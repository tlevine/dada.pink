[[!meta title="Storage services"]]

Here are some attributes of different services. The more appealing services
are earlier in the table.

====================== ================ ========== =============== ==============================

ManhattanMiniStorage_  Storage unit     NY         $40             Receive packages for free
====================== ================ ========== =============== ==============================

\*For storage unit services, the cost is approximate and for the smallest units,
For drop-off/pickup services with many plans, the cost is for the one I am most
likely to use. In both cases, the price is the monthly cost.

All of these services have interesting mail things.

StorageByMail and MakeSpace (outside of New York) use ordinary shipping
services (USPS and UPS, respectively) for pickup and delivery. As far as
I can tell, they will only receive scheduled pickups; I can't buy something
on the internet and have it mailed there.

Storrage, MakeSpace in New York, and BoxBee do their own pick-ups and drop-offs.
None of these receives packages, but BoxBee will ship packages between their
different cities.

I read about a
"`CubeSmart Direct <http://blog.selfstorage.com/self-storage-reits/cubesmart-direct-3496>`_"
with characteristics similar to Storrage and BoxBee, but I found nothing about it on
CubeSmart's website.

ManhattanMiniStorage and CubeSmart both receive packages. CubeSmart is neat in
that they'll put the packages into your storage unit! I think.

MakeSpace, Storrage, and BoxBee look very startuppy. CubeSmart and
ManhattanMiniStorage look very established well-marketed. StorageByMail
is more low-key.

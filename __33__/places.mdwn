It turns out that I do have preferences about where I live!
I have grouped them into things that are very hard to change
(like geology) and things that are less hard to change
(like city planning).


Very hard to change

Cool climate
    I prefer slightly cooler climate than most people do, I think. I realized this when Ana Maria told me about small towns.
Flat topography
    I like walking when it's easy. I don't like hills. I noticed this when hiking with Bryan near Seattle, which was a good contrast to Berlin.

Kind of hard to change

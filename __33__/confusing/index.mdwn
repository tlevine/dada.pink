People sometimes do things that seem unreasonable, mean, inconsiderate,
or otherwise strange. Why would people do such things? It could be that
they are stupid, evil, sociopathic, or just weird, but there's usually
a much simpler explanation.

I remarked that I have a system for noticing this stuff, but I only remember
the different parts of the system when I notice myself using them.
I started writing everything down here in hopes that I might eventually
manage to explain how I do this.

## A summary of the system
I sometimes sense that something is unusual about how a person is acting,
and then I get curious enough to pay more attention.
Paying attention to your feelings is also a good idea in general, even if
you're only concerned with boring things like health and money.

A person's confusing behaviours would usually be much less confusing if
you knew everything else about his or her life. You usually don't know
everything about his or her life, but you can still reduce your confusion
by simply recognizing that his or her life is just as complicated as yours
and that the complications are quite similar.

There are too many fun things to do, and I really like to
[sleep](/!/sleeping/), so I usually just stop at the recognition that
a particular something is interesting about a person. But I sometimes
find that I want to learn more about the person.

When I implicitly decide that I want to learn more about the person,
I pay more attention to the various sorts of cues that would peek my
initial curiosity. I also start asking variations of the question "Why?".

## Why you might care
I think that paying attention to this stuff helps me understand people
(including myself),
to recognize mindgames, and to be direct in communication.
This is how I empathise with people who are being mean,
stressful, angry, cold, manipulative, indirect, or rude.

More importantly, however, understanding people's idiosyncracies is just
really fun.

## Contents
I have divided this piece into five sections. You could read them in the
order that I list them below, but you could also just read whichever one
sounds most interesting.

[Odd Behaviors That Make Me Curious](curiousity)
is a list of some things that raise my curiosity about why a person is
the way he or she is.

In [What Makes Me Investigate My Curiosity?](why-investigate)
I ponder what determines how I act on my curiosity.

[Questions I Ask](questions) discusses some common
patterns of questions that I might ask. I feel like my social skills came
from reading literature on the design of interviews and questionnaires,
and you might see why as you read this section. I try to ask questions
that pass little judgement and are easy to answer.

The three sections above are more about how I try to understand individual
people. There are some special things about groups, and I discuss these in
[Groups As Atomic Units](groups).

In [Neat Results](results) I recount some stories of fun things that happened
after I did these various sorts of things.

[[!meta description="Things I do to learn about people"]]

I'm always curious about everything about people. Well, probably not
everything, but it seems like everything. I'm always curious to see
what a person likes to do, what the person thinks about, how the person
relates to other people, and how this all came to be.

I remarked that there's a system by which I attend to this curiosity,
but I only remember the different parts of the system when I notice
myself using them. I started writing everything down here in hopes that
I might eventually manage to explain how I do this.

## An overview of what I do
I think that I developed my social skills by reading about the design
of interviews and questionnaires. I get pretty far by just asking people
questions and listening to their answers, without interpreting the
answers in much detail.

At the same time, I'm paying attention to a bunch of other things.
Well, this one is always happening, not just while I'm asking people
questions. There is a mental bunch of patterns that I pay attention to,
and much of the present piece is about me trying to remember all of them
and write them down.

Eventually I wind up being I'm curious about something I noticed about
someone. If I'm reasonably relaxed and not too tired, I start asking
questions about these other things I've been noticing.

## When people are being mean or otherwise unpleasant
I'm interested in people even when they're unpleasant to be around.

I first thought to write something like the present piece after learning from
[Matt Linares](http://matt.microsplash.org/) about
[neuro-linguistic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming).
I remarked that I pay attention to the
same sorts of things (without having a name for them) but with the
slightly different focus discussed above: Rather than avoiding being
manipulated, I am interested in understanding why someone would do
something so bizarre.

A common perspective (in law and religion, for example) on people who are
acting mean, rude, manipulative, or otherwise unpleasant is that they are *bad*.
When people are *really* bad, we might even choose to stop them, fix them,
punish them, or just avoid them. This is a nice way for good people to get
into fights with bad people. It makes for an entertaining game, but it's a bit
too exciting for me.

The distinction between good and bad always seems kind of arbitrary to me.
I sometimes find myself among a group of people who are discussing
something *bad* that a person did. The focus is often about how *bad* the
thing was and whether the person should be avoided, punished, &c.
This discussion always seems a bit mean and unempathetic.

When someone acts in a way that displeases me, or when people think that
someone did something bad, I usually become curious as to why the person
did the thing and why the people reacted the way they did. The reasons are
usually interestingly complicated or hilariously simple. Figuring out the
reasons is lots of fun, and thinking about *good* versus *bad* is too stressful.

## Why you might care
I think that paying attention to this stuff helps me understand people
(including myself), to recognize mindgames, and to be direct in communication.
More importantly, understanding people's idiosyncracies is just
really fun.

## Contents
I have divided this piece into five sections. You could read them in the
order that I list them below, but you could also just read whichever one
sounds most interesting.

[Odd Behaviors That Make Me Curious](curiosity)
is a list of some things that raise my curiosity about why a person is
the way he or she is.

In [What Makes Me Investigate My Curiosity?](why-investigate)
I ponder what determines how I act on my curiosity.

[Questions I Ask](questions) discusses some common
patterns of questions that I might ask. I feel like my social skills came
from reading literature on the design of interviews and questionnaires,
and you might see why as you read this section. I try to ask questions
that pass little judgement and are easy to answer.

The three sections above are more about how I try to understand individual
people. There are some special things about groups, and I discuss these in
[Groups As Atomic Units](groups).

In [Neat Results](results) I recount some stories of fun things that happened
after I did these various sorts of things.

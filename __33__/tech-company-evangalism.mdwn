People lately talk about an "evangalist" role in their company.
This might have been considered a combination of "advertising",
"marketing", or "sales" in the past.

Here's how I think one should go about it.

## Big companies or small companies
Decide whether you are going after big companies with long sales processes
or after tiny companies that probably aren't going to exist next year.

## If you are going after big companies
Your presentations, brochures, &c. should focus on the value

## If you are going after small companies

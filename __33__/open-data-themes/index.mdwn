I've recently been looking at the metadata about a bunch of
government-produced spreadsheets and seeing what I come up with.
Here I review some themes that are coming out of this study.

## Quantifying data quality
People have ideas about what makes for good data or for good
open data. (reference them.)
For example, data are supposed to be up-to-date.

These concepts of good-quality data are hard to measure,
so I've been coming up with ways of measuring them quantitatively.
This allows me to put numbers on the quality of different data
and thus to compare data quality across different groups of data.

## Searching for data
We search for prose by typing prose in a search bar; why don't
we search for spreadsheets by uploading a spreadsheet?

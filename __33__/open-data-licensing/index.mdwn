I downloaded all of the metadata files from 102 open data
portals hosted on CKAN, Socrata and OpenDataSoft. Each of
these data portal softwares has a metadata field for the
license of each particular dataset. In the present article,
I look at this metadata field.

**tl;dr**: It turns out that most of
the datasets don't have licenses. Or if they do, it's not
specified in this field. I think it would be nice if they did.

## The portals
I looked at [these portals](https://github.com/tlevine/open-data-download/blob/3115221f193e08d2e83eb753e8154ea9593fec55/portals.py),
but I ignored the following three because they aren't associated with specific governments.

* datahub.io
* datastore.opendatasoft.com
* opendata.socrata.com

## Reducing license names
I made a [rough mapping](https://github.com/tlevine/open-data-download/blob/3115221f193e08d2e83eb753e8154ea9593fec55/query-license.py#L5)
between the free-form names of the
licenses and some standard licenses.
For example, [CC0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) 
and other public domain licenses got grouped into "Public Domain".

I didn't test this
very well, so there are probably some errors, but I think
these results are still informative.

## Do people specify a license at all?
In doing this, I distinguished between whether a license was
specified. Here's a histogram of the proportion of datasets
with licenses, by portal. Portals on the right of the graph
specified licenses for most of their datasets, and portals on
the left specified licenses for few of their datasets.

I was actually slightly surprised that people had set licenses
at all.

## Which licenses?
Then I looked at what these licenses (after I reduced them to
a few standard names) were.

As we saw in the previous plot, most datasets don't specify a
license. They might be specified elsewhere.
While many datasets have standard open licenses, the licenses

## How do portals differ?
I looked at the variation in this across portal.

<a href="p4.png"><img src="p4.png" alt="Data licenses by portal" class="wide" /></a>

`publicdata.eu` is pretty big. Like the three portals that I removed
at the beginning, it isn't associated with a particular government,
so I removed it.

## Do people put licenses elsewhere?
I looked around the websites for a few portals to see whether they
grant a license somewhere else in the website. Let's group them into
two groups: Portals that specify lots of open licenses and portals
that don't specify very many license

### Lots of open licenses

#### Houston
Everything's public domain on the
[data.codeforhouston.com](http://data.codeforhouston.com/dataset/city-of-houston-funds),
and it says so in the individual datasets, but there's no site-wide
license page that explains this.

#### United Kingdom
`data.gov.uk` is [more explicit](http://data.gov.uk/terms-and-conditions).

> The data and information available through www.data.gov.uk are available under terms described in the “licence” or "constraints" field of individual dataset records (meta-data). Except where otherwise noted this is the Open Government Licence.
> 
> All dataset records (meta-data) published on www.data.gov.uk are licensed under the Open Government Licence.

### Few licenses

#### Oregon
The closest thing I could find to a license on Oregon's data portal was
[this](http://www.oregon.gov/Pages/datamoderation.aspx).

> **Source Data**
> Applications using data supplied by this site must include the following disclaimers on their sites:
>
> > "The data made available here has been modified for use from its original source, which is the State of Oregon. THE STATE OF OREGON MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTY AS TO THE COMPLETENESS, ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, OR CONTENT OF ANY DATA MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THIS SITE. THE STATE OF OREGON EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. The data is subject to change as modifications and updates are complete. It is understood that the information contained in the Web feed is being used at one's own risk."

I suppose that implies that it is okay to copy the data, modify
the data and supply your application with it, but is this enough
to give you the right to do that?

#### Italy
Few datasets on [it.ckan.net](http://it.ckan.net) specify licenses,
but it says in two places
that most everything is released under the Open Database License.
The ["Meta" section](http://it.ckan.net/#credits) of the footer says this.

> © 2012 Open Knowledge Foundation Disponibile nei termini della Open Database License

And the [about/informazioni](http://it.ckan.net/about) page says this.

> Most of the data indexed at CKAN Italia is openly licensed, meaning anyone is free to use or re-use it however they like. Perhaps someone will take that nice dataset of a city's public art that you found, and add it to a tourist map - or even make a neat app for your phone that'll help you find artworks when you visit the city. Open data means more enterprise, collaborative science and transparent government. You can read more about open data in the Open Data Handbook.

Perhaps this implies that everything is licensed under ODbL unless
something specifies otherwise?

## Why licenses matter
Datasets on data portals often lack licenses, and there sometimes
isn't a site-wide license for data portals. We sort of don't need
licenses on these data portals, but I'd like to see them.

### Why we sort of don't need it
For at least some data portals, it might be kind of safe to assume
that everything on it is free for your use.

In the United States, this might not be too big of an issue because
[you can't copyright data](http://www.lib.umich.edu/copyright/facts-and-data).

Also, products of the United States federal government are public domain,
so I'd love to think that everything on at least `data.gov` is in the public domain.

### Why we sort of need it

> [Licensing is important because it reduces uncertainty.](http://opendatacommons.org/faq/)

In some contexts, the creator of data can't restrict you from copying them,
remixing them and distributing derived works. But it's hard to know whether
you are in such a context. For example, Oregon apparently has the right to
require you to add a disclaimer to software that use Oregon data.

The White House gets this. Even though products of the federal government
are already in the public domain, the White house website makes this
[explicit](http://www.whitehouse.gov/copyright).

Even if the public already has the right to the data, you should make this
clear on the website. This is especially relevant when someone is downloading
datasets from 100 different portals run by different governments; it's nice
not to look up the intellectual property laws for all of the different places.

## Add a license!
If you run a data portal, add a license, even if you don't really need one.
Hmm I suppose I should tell you which license.

If your data portal is associated with a government,
[Creative Commons Zero](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)
seems like a good one to me. This effectively allows anyone to do anything with
the data as if she had produced them herself.

If you want to enforce that datasets derived from your dataset be released
openly, consider something like the
[Open Database License](http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/summary/).

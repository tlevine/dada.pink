Stopwatches instead of real time because it's easier to say and
synchronize and because they have seconds on phones

Delay and offset

Whiteboard with T0, T1 = T2, T3

Do trips in this order

* One trip just to walk through the steps
* One trip where the person runs as fast as she can
* One trip where the person walks for one leg and runs for the other
* Huff-and-puff filter: Everyone sprints.

Record the true offset.
Record the times for each one.
Check whether the ones with the lowest delay have the most accurate offset.

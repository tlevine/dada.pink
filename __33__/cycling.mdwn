While standing at a look-out place looking out over some pretty water
in Seattle, I got into a conversation with a person who was also there
and also with a bike. He said that highway 101 is a great place to bike
long distances and that there's camping along the way. This sounds fun.
I have been wanting to go camping without a car.

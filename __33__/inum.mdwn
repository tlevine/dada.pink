Calling me on the phone from another country might ordinarily be expensive
for you, so I have an [international number (iNum)](http://www.inum.net/).

> [883510009902082](tel:883510009902082)

iNums are supposed to be effectively local numbers regardless of where you
are in the world, but many providers don't implement that properly, so you
can use an
[access number](http://www.inum.net/what-is-inum-2/local-access-numbers/)
for the region you are calling me from. Here are
[directions](http://www.inum.net/call-inum-from-your-cell-phone/)
for saving the combined access number and iNum in your phone.

Graphical programs that Redon uses and some suggested CLI equivalents

Thunderbird
    Setting up mutt and everything would be a bit of work, but maybe just a search thing, for example, could help.
Banshee
    I use `mplayer <mplayer>`_ for music.
LibreOffice
    Depending on what he's doing, LaTeX or other text files or maybe a markdown to pdf thing
Transmission
    I still use the GUI for this. (And I use either Transmission or Deluge.)
Screenshots
    This is the easiest one! It's called `import <import>`_, and it's in imagemagick.
Calculator
    Any interpreted language would be great. More `here <calculator>`_

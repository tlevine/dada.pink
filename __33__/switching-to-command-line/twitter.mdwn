Elio asked about a [Twitter](https://twitter.com) client. Do they exist?
I searched my package manager (`pacman` because I'm using Arch Linux).

    $ pacman -Ss twitter
    extra/bitlbee 3.2.2-1
        Brings instant messaging (XMPP, MSN, Yahoo!, AIM, ICQ, Twitter) to IRC
    community/bti 034-1
        Console client for Twitter and identi.ca
    community/choqok 1.4-2
        A Twitter/identi.ca/laconica client for KDE
    community/perl-term-readline-ttytter 1.4-2
        A Perl readline for the ttytter twitter client
    community/ttytter 2.1.00-4
        A multi-functional, command-line twitter client

They do! I've used bti and ttytter before, and I preferred ttytter, so we're
going to do that. First, install ttytter.

    sudo pacman -S ttytter

Run it for the first time.

    $ ttytter 
    -- using SSL for default URLs.
    trying to find cURL ... /usr/bin/curl
    -- Streaming API disabled (no -dostream) (TTYtter will use REST API only)
    -- no version check performed (use /vcheck, or -vcheck to check on startup)

    || WELCOME TO TTYtter: Authorize TTYtter by signing into Twitter with OAuth ||

    Looks like you're starting TTYtter for the first time, and/or creating a
    keyfile. Welcome to the most user-hostile, highly obfuscated, spaghetti code
    infested and obscenely obscure Twitter client that's out there. You'll love it.

    TTYtter generates a keyfile that contains credentials for you, including your
    access tokens. This needs to be done JUST ONCE. You can take this keyfile with
    you to other systems. If you revoke TTYtter's access, you must remove the
    keyfile and start again with a new token. You need to do this once per account
    you use with TTYtter; only one account token can be stored per keyfile. If you
    have multiple accounts, use -keyf=... to specify different keyfiles. KEEP THESE
    FILES SECRET.

    3. Verify that TTYtter is the requesting application, and that its permissions
    are as you expect (read your timeline, see who you follow and follow new
    people, update your profile, post tweets on your behalf and access your
    direct messages). IF THIS IS NOT CORRECT, PRESS CTRL-C NOW!

    4. Click Authorize app.

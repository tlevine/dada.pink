I play music and video files with
[mplayer]().
I usually run a command like one of the following

    mplayer this-song.ogg # play a song
    mplayer this-album/04-that-song.mp3 # play another song
    mplayer this-album/* # play all the songs in this album
    mplayer this-artist/*/* # play all of the songs by this artist

(Press "q" to close.)

I sometimes use the `-shuffle` flag.

    mplayer -shuffle this-album/*

I don't listen to music very much, and I don't usually use many
other features of mplayer. But it supports playlists, streams,
and so on; read more at

    man mplayer

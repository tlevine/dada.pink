Do you want to use command lines more and window/buttons less?
Let's write down some things that we do with graphical interfaces
and then figure out how to do them with command line interfaces.
And then we can write drections so that we can look up how to do
these things when we forget (and also so other people can read them).


Graphical programs that Redon uses and some suggested CLI equivalents

Thunderbird
    Setting up mutt and everything would be a bit of work, but maybe just a search thing, for example, could help.
Banshee
    I use `mplayer <mplayer>`_ for music.
LibreOffice
    Depending on what he's doing, LaTeX or other text files or maybe a markdown to pdf thing
Transmission
    I still use the GUI for this. (And I use either Transmission or Deluge.)
Screenshots
    This is the easiest one! It's called `import <import>`_, and it's in imagemagick.
Calculator
    Any interpreted language would be great. More `here <calculator>`_

Do you want to use command lines more and window/buttons less?
Let's write down some things that we do with graphical interfaces
and then figure out how to do them with command line interfaces.
And then we can write directions so that we can look up how to do
these things when we forget (and also so other people can read them).
Note: this started during Wikipedia Weekend in Tirana 2014 (http://openlabs.cc/si-te-perdorim-command-line/), where Redon became curious about how it could be using his computer only using command line. So they agreed to host a workshop and invite people that might be interested on something like this. Orven, Elio, Ilda and Greta showed up to the workshop. 
Things also progressed when Besfort organized the same workshop in Prishtina.  

I talked to a lot of people at Wikipedia Weekend, the workshop at
OpenLabs, and the workshop at Prishtina Hackerspace. Pretty much everyone
needed these things.

* Web browser
* Email client
* Word processor

And most people needed other things too.

These are all rather huge concepts, so we're not going to find one
command that replaces everything; that would be against the
`Unix philosophy <>`_.
Instead, we pick apart the details of each program and find programs
that do each part.

Here are some things that we found command-line equivalents for.

* `Editor for web development <>`_
* `Word processor <>`_

The command line is better, but it takes a while to learn, so Tom
uses the graphical interfaces until he learns the command line.

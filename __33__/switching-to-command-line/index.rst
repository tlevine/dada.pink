Graphical programs that Redon uses and some suggested CLI equivalents

Thunderbird
    Setting up mutt and everything would be a bit of work, but maybe just a search thing, for example, could help.
Banshee
    I use `mplayer <mplayer>`_ for music.
LibreOffice
    Hmm really just latex or text files or maybe a markdown to pdf thing
Transmission
    I still use the GUI for this
Screenshots
    This is the easiest one! It's called `import <import>`, and it's in imagemagick.
Calculator
    Any interpreted language

Do you want to use command lines more and window/buttons less?
Let's write down some things that we do with graphical interfaces
and then figure out how to do them with command line interfaces.
And then we can write directions so that we can look up how to do
these things when we forget (and also so other people can read them).

Origins
-----------
This started during
`Wikipedia Weekend in Tirana 2014 <http://openlabs.cc/si-te-perdorim-command-line/>`_,
where Redon saw Tom doing some rather ordinary things on a command line and
became curious about what it would be like to use his computer only with only
the command line. So they agreed to host a
`workshop <>`_
and invite people that might be interested on something like this.
Orven, Elio, Ilda and Greta showed up to the workshop. 
Tom also led a
`similar workshop <>`_ at
`Prishtina Hackerspace <>`_.
And this has continued in other contexts ever since.

Process
------------
I talked to a lot of people at Wikipedia Weekend, the workshop at
OpenLabs, and the workshop at Prishtina Hackerspace. Pretty much everyone
needed these things.

* Web browser
* Email client
* Word processor

And most people needed other things too.

These are all rather huge concepts, so we're not going to find one
command that replaces everything; that would be against the
`Unix philosophy <>`_.
Instead, we pick apart the details of each program and find programs
that do each part.

Results
------------
Here are some things that we found command-line equivalents for.

* `Text editing for web development <vim>`_
* `Taking screenshots <>`_
* `Playing music <>`_
* `Word processing <>`_
* `Twitter client <>`_




Email client (Arianit)


And here are some things that we didn't look into very far.

* Wordpress: http://wp-cli.org/
* Firefox ``firefox --new-tab 'https://duckduckgo.com/html?q=aspell'``

Final note
-------------
In case all of these commands intimidate you, know that they also
intimidate Tom!
The command line is better, but it takes a while to learn, so Tom
uses the graphical interfaces until he learns the command line.

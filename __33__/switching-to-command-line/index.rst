Do you want to use command lines more and window/buttons less?
Let's write down some things that we do with graphical interfaces
and then figure out how to do them with command line interfaces.
And then we can write directions so that we can look up how to do
these things when we forget (and also so other people can read them).

Origins
-----------
This started during
`Wikipedia Weekend in Tirana 2014 <http://openlabs.cc/si-te-perdorim-command-line/>`_,
where Redon saw Tom doing some rather ordinary things on a command line and
became curious about what it would be like to use his computer only with only
the command line. So they agreed to host a
`workshop <>`_
and invite people that might be interested on something like this.
Orven, Elio, Ilda and Greta showed up to the workshop. 
Tom also led a
`similar workshop <>`_ at
`Prishtina Hackerspace <>`_.
And this has continued in other contexts ever since.

Process
------------
I asked people what graphical programs they used. People used music
players like `Banshee <>`_,
word processors like `LibreOffice <>`_,
email clients like `Thunderbird <>`_,
and many other things.
These are all rather huge concepts, so we're not going to find one
command that replaces everything; that would be against the
`Unix philosophy <>`_.
Instead, we pick apart the details of each program and find programs
that do each part.

Results
------------
Here are some things that we found command-line equivalents for.

* `Text editing for web development <vim>`_
* `Taking screenshots <>`_
* `Playing music <>`_
* `Word processing <>`_
* `Twitter client <twitter>`_

We also wrote up some notes on basic command-line things.

* `Colors <colors>`_
* `* <star>`_

And here are some things that talked about but didn't look into very far.

* If you use Wordpress a lot, check out `wb-cli <http://wp-cli.org/>`_.
* Email: I have a lot to say about it, but we didn't manage to pick
  apart the features of email clients that people really cared about.
* Firefox: ``firefox --new-tab 'https://duckduckgo.com/html?q=aspell'``

Final note
-------------
In case all of these commands intimidate you, know that they also
intimidate Tom!
The command line is better, but it takes a while to learn, so Tom
uses the graphical interfaces until he learns the command line.

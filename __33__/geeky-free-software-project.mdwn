[Redon](http://skikuli.com) asked me to present a "geeky open source
(and free software culture) related project [I] have done". This request
seemed a bit odd at first because pretty much everything I do could be
seen as related to free software/culture. So I decided that everything is
a huge meta-project about exploring outrageous degrees of freedom.

Let's break this into three things.

1. The interesting part about free software/culture is just sharing.
2. Cool things happen because people share information with me.
3. Cool happen I can do because I share information.

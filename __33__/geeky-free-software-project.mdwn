[Redon](http://skikuli.com) asked me to present a "geeky open source
(and free software culture) related project [I] have done". This request
seemed a bit odd at first because pretty much everything I do could be
seen as related to free software/culture. So I decided that everything is
a huge meta-project about exploring outrageous degrees of freedom.

Let's break this into three things.

1. The interesting part about free software/culture is just sharing.
2. Cool things happen because people share information with me.
3. Cool happen I can do because I share information.

## On sharing
When things seem like magic, it's like the modification of my
surroundings are beyond my control and I am dependent on some outside
something. But real magic is rather uncommon, and recognizing that
most things aren't magic gives me [agency](/!/why-i-like-hackerspaces/).

I use computers to make *my* life easier. I get computers to help me
[stay in touch with people](http://small.dada.pink/whom-to-email),
[study myself](http://small.dada.pink/dadawarehouse),
[study](/open-data)
[other](/!/wrist-cracking)
[things](/scarsdale),
[remember things](http://small.dada.pink/schedule).

## People share with me

If you want to learn computer and don't have a particular reason to,
I think you should learn
[these computer things](/!/what-programming-to-learn/).

<dl>
<dt>How to write things</dt>
<dd>emacs, vim, or text manipulation in shell</dd>
<dt>Better than DropBox</dt>
<dd>basics of scp, sftp, or rsync</dd>
<dt>Maybe some good email programs</dt>
<dd>mutt, pine, notmuch, mh, &c. (My [email](/!/email) setup is very cool but presently not documented.)</dd>
</dl>

These 30-year-old programs are still better than anything else; that's
why people still use them!

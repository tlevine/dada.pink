I'm going to tell you some things I have noticed recently and then see if you
have advice for me regarding what I might want to do (for work or whatever).

## I like work that isn't much work
I have been trying to figure out what makes me like work, and all I have come
up with is that I want not to work. That is, I like work when it pays, isn't
much work (part-time, easy application process, not over-time, &c).

Saying that I like work that isn't much work simply defers the issue of what
I like to do. I like work that gives me time to do things that I want to do,
but what are those things that I want to do?

## The things I like doing
Most of the things I like to do can be seen as indirect manifestations of my
aversion to work and to other stressful things.

For example, I blew dorm politics [out of proportion](/!/risley-toilets) for
the hilarity; I gradually concluded that open data has nothing to do with
transparency and everything to do about
[big money](/!/open-data-is-all-about-money/) and
[hype for hype's sake](/!/searching-data-tables-better);
and my mission to enlighten people to
[musical data analysis](http://fms.csvsoundsystem.com) has
[spiraled](sheetmusic)
[out](eusprig)
[of](geomdoner)
[control](brighttalk)

Some other things can be seen as more direct manifestations of this aversion
to work, such as [this recent (not finished) writing](/!/silly)

## Do I want to do something good for the world?
Could it be that I want to do something "good" for the world?
I [seem]()
to like [DataKind](),
I care something about [open data](
but I'm skeptical that it's doing much for the world; I mostly just like
them because they make me feel [happy]().

People say I have done important stuff related to 

enough money that I can retire

/!/curriculum-vitae

I much prefer when work is mundane rather than a grand mission to save the world.

To start, I really like to [sleep](/!/sleeping) and otherwise do nothing.

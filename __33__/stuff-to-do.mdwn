I'm going to tell you some things I have noticed recently and then see if you
have advice for me regarding what I might want to do (for work or whatever).

## Not working
I have been trying to figure out what makes me like work, and all I have come
up with is that I want not to work. That is, I like work when it pays, isn't
much work (part-time, easy application process, not over-time, &c).

## Doing something good for the world?
enough money that I can retire

/!/curriculum-vitae

I much prefer when work is mundane rather than a grand mission to save the world.

## The things I like doing
All of the things I like to do are aspects of this broader aversion to work
and to tiring emotion.

For example, I really like to [sleep](/!/sleeping). And the more culturally
accepted things that I like to do are manifestations of my frustration with

indirect criticism

[dorm politics](/!/risley-toilets),
[open openness](/open-data),
[buzzy data

more direct
/!/silly

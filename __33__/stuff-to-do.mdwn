I'm going to tell you some things I have noticed recently and then see if you
have advice for me regarding what I might want to do (for work or whatever).

## I like work that isn't much work
I have been trying to figure out what makes me like work, and all I have come
up with is that I want not to work. That is, I like work when it pays, isn't
much work (part-time, easy application process, not over-time, &c).

Saying that I like work that isn't much work simply defers the issue of what
I like to do. I like work that gives me time to do things that I want to do,
but what are those things that I want to do?

## The things I like doing
It seems that all of the things I like to do are aspects of this broader
aversion to work and to tiresome emotion.

And the more culturally
accepted things that I like to do are manifestations of my frustration with

indirect criticism

[dorm politics](/!/risley-toilets),
[open openness](/open-data),
[buzzy data

more direct

## Do I want to do something good for the world?
I wonder whether I want to do something "good" for the world.
I [seem]()
to like [DataKind](),
but I'm skeptical that it's doing much for the world; I mostly just like
them because they make me feel [happy]().

People say I have done important stuff related to 

enough money that I can retire

I much prefer when work is mundane rather than a grand mission to save the world.

To start, I really like to [sleep](/!/sleeping) and otherwise do nothing.

"Templating" and "templating engines" might sound very fancy. There
are so many considerations! And there are a bunch of wacky cool things
like [MediaWiki templates](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Templates),
[Haml](http://haml.info), and
[Blaze](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/happstack-authenticate-0.10.4/docs/Happstack-Auth-Blaze-Templates.html)
that get called templating languages but look way different from things
like [ejs](http://www.embeddedjs.com/) and [Jinja](http://jinja.pocoo.org/),
which are also called templating languages.

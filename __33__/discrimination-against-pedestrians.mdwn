I recently got a bicycle for the first time in pretty much forever,
and I have been realizing that it is way easier to get around on bicycle
than on foot, even in cities places that supposedly aren't good for
cycling. This didn't make sense to me. Bicycles are bulky objects that
do best on flat and smooth surfaces (especially mine) and are easy to
steal; surely bicycles should be more annoying. It finally hit me that
cycling is so much easier because we actually design the environment
for cycling, and not for walking.

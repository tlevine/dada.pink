People often complain that things are designed in various ways that don't
support cycling. When they say this, they probably mean that the environment
is worse for cycling than for for driving. Somehow, people never talk about
how all these things that are worse for cycling than for driving are even
worse for walking.


## How I realized this
I recently got a bicycle for the first time in pretty much forever,
and I have been realizing that it is way easier to get around on bicycle
than on foot, even in cities places that supposedly aren't good for
cycling. This didn't make sense to me. Bicycles are bulky objects that
do best on flat and smooth surfaces (especially mine) and are easy to
steal; surely bicycles should be more annoying. It finally hit me that
cycling is so much easier because we actually design the environment
for cycling, and not for walking.

Most people probably wouldn't notice the stuff I have noticed. I have
never had a car, and I only just got a bicycle; before getting the bicycle,
I walked everywhere. Also, I'm pretty okay with spending three hours
walking somewhere, so I walk more than most people.

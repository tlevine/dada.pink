## Abstract
When someone is mean or rude to me, lots of people like to say that
the person did something bad, to punish or ignore the person, and then
to move on. 

so it's usually a pretty
good idea to just ignore people when they're acting like this.

The word "lying" isn't quite appropriate to describe these behaviors,
so I usually use the word "silly" to describe the collection of
manipulative, deceptive, rude, mean, angry, &c. that I'm discussing.
More precisely, I consider a behavior to be silly when it involves
a person who is lying to himself or herself and is upsetting another
person in the process.



I am always curious as to why people are ever mean, rude, manipulative,
deceptive, and other silly things.

This piece discusses how [I](/) identify such behaviors and then figure
out why people are displaying them. I also discuss common patterns from
various scenarios.
This knowledge can help you to understand people (including yourself),
to recognize mindgames, and to be direct in communication. Moreover,
I hope that it helps you empathise with people who are being mean,
stressful, and rude.

## Why I write this
I am usually quite interested by why anyone acts the way she or he does.
I thought to write this piece after learning from
[Matt Linares](http://matt.microsplash.org/) about
[neuro-linguistic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming).
I remarked that I pay attention to the
same sorts of things (without having a name for them) but with the
slightly different focus discussed above.

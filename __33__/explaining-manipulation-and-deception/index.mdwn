## Abstract
When people are being mean for apparently no reason, it is easy for me
to get quite frustrated with the world and to distrust everything.
Will this person who was nice yesterday suddenly turn bad? Will I suddenly
turn bad, and will everyone hate me then? I can hide my frustration by
saying that the person is being mean because he or she is a bad person, but
that leads to other unpleasant things because this is never the real reason.

It turns out that there usually is a simple explanation that doesn't require
me to hate the person nor the world; in the present piece, I'll show you how
I come up with this explanation.

My method can help you to understand people (including yourself),
to recognize mindgames, and to be direct in communication. Moreover,
I hope that it helps you empathise with people who are being mean,
stressful, and rude.

## Definition
The word "lying" isn't quite appropriate to describe these behaviors,
so I usually use the word "silly" to describe the collection of
manipulative, deceptive, rude, mean, angry, &c. that I'm discussing.

More precisely, I consider a behavior to be silly when it involves
a person who is lying to himself or herself and is upsetting another
person in the process.

## Why I write this
I am usually quite interested by why anyone acts the way she or he does.
I thought to write this piece after learning from
[Matt Linares](http://matt.microsplash.org/) about
[neuro-linguistic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming).
I remarked that I pay attention to the
same sorts of things (without having a name for them) but with the
slightly different focus discussed above: Rather than avoiding being
manipulated, I am interested in understanding why someone would do
something so bizarre.

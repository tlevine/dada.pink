## Pay attention when something seems off
I sometimes get an odd feelings about things, and I sometimes try to figure
out what the feelings are and where they're coming from. Pay attention when
you get odd feelings, and you'll eventually start to figure out what they
mean. 

The rest of this piece is only my attempt to organize the various things I
have learned about silliness by paying attention to these feelings, and I am
bound to have missed something. Moreover, paying attention to your feelings
is a good idea in general, even if you're only concerned with boring things
like health and money.

## Silly behavior is about the person being silly
Sometimes, we see a person (or group) trying to manipulate or deceive
another person (or group). Such behaviors are often discussed as
involving two persons: the person doing the manipulation and the person
being manipulated.

The same goes for when a person is being especially rude or angry.
Something triggered the rudeness or anger, but the rudeness or anger
is really about something broader and deeper and a bit more complicated.

When person A is angry at person B and is manipulating person B, it is
really that person A is angry at himself or herself and that person A
is manipulating himself or herself; person A's implicit goal in
controlling person B is to validate or to hide person A's feelings.

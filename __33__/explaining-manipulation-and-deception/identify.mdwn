I sometimes get an odd feelings about things, and I sometimes try to figure
out what the feelings are and where they're coming from.




<!-- You might say that I have developed some intuition about this stuff. -->

## When speech sounds forced
Sometimes, 

I recall finding myself in a circle of people where one person mentioned
that he had just quit his job and then everyone except me (literally)
applauded very loudly. That seemed a bit odd. I think that everyone either
had just quit his/her job or was considering quitting his/her job and was
looking for confirmation that he/she was making a good choice.

## Anger
Even if people seem to be legitimately angry, there is probably something
more complex going on. For example, lots of people get upset when the
government does stupid things, but people who are involved with activism
seem to be looking for something other than change in the government.

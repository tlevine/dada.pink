## Motivation for silliness
Silliness occurs when it is hard for people to be as they want to be or
to do as they want to do. For example, if someone is usually especially
[consciencious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits#Conscientiousness)
and is put in a situation where things are always crazy, that person
might start doing silly things.

### Typical life motivations
You probably have some intuition about what people want in life.
(It might just seem like common sense.) In case you think you don't,
you might read what these various fancy people thought.

* Big five
* Erikson
* Kohlberg
* ...

I think that all of these are mostly right if you interpret them
as they were intended to be interpreted.

### Reasons why it might be hard for someone to act on these motivations

* Culture, norms
* Money/power
* Prejudice
* Friend groups
* Sudden changes

### People get angry can't get what they want
Even if people seem to be legitimately angry, there is probably something
more complex going on. For example, lots of people get upset when the
government does stupid things, but people who are involved with activism
seem to be looking for something other than change in the government.
That is, the people who want a change in environmental policy also want

* Food
* A place to sleep
* Homeliness
* Friends
* A purpose in life
* ...

Everyone else wants these things too, but it's harder for some people to
get these things. The people who get particularly about not having one
of these things are usually the ones who are having a hard time getting
the other things.


## Specific things you can do
Silliness can usually be explained with the reasons above, but we still
need to figure out exactly what the reason is. Here are some things I do
as I am trying to figure out the specific motivation for a particular
person's silliness.

### Pay attention to the questions people ask

### Things that are written about someone were often written by that someone

### Ignore the topic of discussion and instead ask why

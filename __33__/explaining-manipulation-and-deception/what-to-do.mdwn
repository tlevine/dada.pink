What to do when you think you know is going on

## Diffusing arguments

## Predicting behavior

## Being more direct


It will probably take a while for you to get more direct with the person who
is being silly

More immediately, recognizing what's going on (or even just investigating it)
can help you be more direct with other people have noticed the silly behavior.
Some people want to talk about the stuff but are afraid of starting the
discussion.

## But mostly, it's just fun to know
When I have some understanding of why a particular person is being so
mean, rude, aggressive, manipulative, deceptive, &c., I have more hope
for the world. Rather than thinking that the person must be evil, I
realize that she or he is just being silly.

People sometimes ask me questions that are far more complicated than I
am in the mood to answer. In such cases, I might still be in the mood
to talk a bit further and to arrive at a question that I am in the mood
to answer. If you have asked me a question and we haven't managed to
come up with a question that I am in the mood to answer, the following

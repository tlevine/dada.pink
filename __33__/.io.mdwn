[[!meta title="Why do people like .io domains so much?"]]
[[!meta description="Well duh it's like input/output, but why are people so into it?"]]

I remarked that I'm usually not excited to hear about things ending in
".io" because I think it's going to be a boring company product that's
making a big deal about nothing. Why do I think this? Also, how did a
top-level domain for an Indian Ocean territory get so popular?

## My intuition
My intuition is that [socket.io](http://socket.io) and maybe some other
sites with similar audiences explains the recent popularity. socket.io
runs on Node, which was rather unstable at the time that socket.io first
got popular. The sort of people who knew about it and thought it was cool
were the ones making websites on with all this fancy brand new Node stuff,
and .io became associated with websites like this.

Then I guess it got mainstream and all of the big people wanted it too
and now it's not cool anymore.

Anyway, is any this hunch at all true? Let's see if I can figure that out.

## Perception as artisinal
I started by looking around for an article like the one that I am writing
right now. Unfortunately, I didn't find one, so I had to write it.
The closest articles I did find, however, mentioned that people see .io websites
as artisinal and well crafted.

## Checking WHOIS information
[The oldest.io domains](http://blog.park.io/articles/the-first-io-domain-ever-registered/)
inspired me to look through the WHOIS information for some of the more known .io domains
in order to find when they were first registered.

## Some other fun things I found along the way
Read about [how .co and .info thought about marketing](https://www.quora.com/How-did-the-co-TLD-become-so-popular).

Google [doesn't consider](http://clay.io/blog/an-appeal-to-google-make-io-a-gcctld/)
.io websites to be located in the Indian Ocean.

Does .io [support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.io#Controversy) the
[United States military](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Justice_%28Diego_Garcia%29) rather
than the [Chagossians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chagossians),
the indigenous people of the Indian Ocean Territory that was recently
[deported](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depopulation_of_Chagossians_from_the_Chagos_Archipelago)?

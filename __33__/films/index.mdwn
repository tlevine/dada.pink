[[!meta title="Films I like"]]

I find that I fall asleep during movies,
so I tend to prefer movies that are enhanced
by falling asleep. Here are some.

## Donnie Darko
Periodically falling asleep made
*Donnie Darko* way more creepy; I'd wake
up and that rabbit thing would suddenly be there.

## Serial Experiments Lain
I watched the whole *Serial Experiments Lain*
series in one session. I was using workstation
that let me lie down on the floor and look up
at a monitor mounted above my head, so I quite
comfortably drifted in and out of sleep.

Each episode starts with the same image and
sound clip, but sometimes they play that image
and sound in the middle of episodes. I would
often arrive at that clip and wonder whether
I'd fallen asleep.

My workstation probably added to the trippiness.
The series challenges the distinction between
virtual and reality and has situations where
people exist in the wired (sort of like the
internet) but not in the normal world, and my
entry into this cockpit-like computer station
and subsequent unconsciousness sounds a lot like
entering the wired.

## Snakes on a Plane
I saw the person get murdered, and I fell asleep
after the snakes got into the plane cabin. When
I woke up, the one guy thanked the other guy for
his help with the snakes. But what about the murder????

I'm told that the film was pretty bad and that
I didn't miss anything.

## Inception

## La science des RÃªves

## Clerks, &c.
I fell asleep while watching *Clerks* with some friends.
I periodically woke up and had trouble following the plot.
By the end, I was sightly confused because there weren't
anymore clerks; instead, there were jewel thieves.
Oh and the film was suddenly in color.

It turns out that we had finished *Clerks*. After *Clerks*,
my friends put on *Clerks II*. And after that finished, they
put on *Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back*.

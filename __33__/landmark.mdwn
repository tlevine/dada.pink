I'm sitting in this Landmark thingy guest....

It was really obvious that the whole thing is a marketing pitch.
And then they showed the full-blown marketing video. And then it all
made sense.

I think it's a simplified version of hippie-sounding things like
meditation and whatnot but packaged in a very high-class, businessy
way to make it palatable to that sort of person.

It's probably good for people in the same way that those other things are.

They sell to big stuffy companies in a stuffy way because these companies
need this consciousness or whatnot but want to pretend they don't.

Well we're only a few minutes into the evening. Let's see what happens next!

I'm sitting in this Landmark thingy guest....
November 26, 2014 in Seattle

It was really obvious that the whole thing is a marketing pitch.
And then they showed the full-blown marketing video. And then it all
made sense.

I think it's a simplified version of hippie-sounding things like
meditation and whatnot but packaged in a very high-class, businessy
way to make it palatable to that sort of person.

It's probably good for people in the same way that those other things are.

They sell to big stuffy companies in a stuffy way because these companies
need this consciousness or whatnot but want to pretend they don't.

Well we're only a few minutes into the evening. Let's see what happens next!

Oh fun! They learn to do a bunch of things that I already do!

* It seems that much of the course is about providing language to describe emotions.
* They make your problems "disappear". They show people that it's not worth
    having these problems; there are more important things in life.
    This is related to my interest in [sleep](/!/sleeping/)
* Speaking in the first person. ("I say ..." rather than "People say ...")
* They use the word "racquet" to describe resentment or complaints that we
    continue to display for a long time. Theoretically, they say, we should
    usually want to do something about the thing we're complaining about;
    if people keep complaining and not doing something about the thing, they're
    complaining because complaining gives them something, like the feeling
    of "being right" about the thing they're complaining about.
    This is an aspect of my writing on [silliness](/!/silly/).

There are some other words that I don't quite get.

* Integrity
* Stuck

[[!meta title="Why dada"]]

I've never particularly liked explaining what I "do", and I
think I kind of reject the concept of such categorization.
I wrote an article for a very uninteresting and businessy
publication, and the editor asked for my job title.

> 1. We have put a "Job Title" / description beneath each author's name.
> What should I put for yours? "!" ;-) "Data Researcher" "Data Tinkerer"
> "Data Artist"

None of these felt quite right.

What about da**d**a? [David Riordan]()
had invented big dada at the Students for Free Culture
conference a few months prior and convinced me to give a
lightning talk about the relationship between free culture
and the data thing.

I read multiple
[dada]()
[manifestos]()
and thought that Dada was a rather perfect description
for what I do.
So I told her "Dada Artist".

I don't
know whether they wound up using it in this publication, but I've been using it
ever since.

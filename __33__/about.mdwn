I like to [sleep](/!/sleeping/), and I'm usually
curious about why people do anything else.
My favorite color is [pink](/img/me-420.png).

## Ergonomics
I started playing with computers since I was about 13.
By back and wrists started hurting a couple years later.
Then I started studying ergonomics.
Then my back and wrists didn't hurt as much.
And then I went to university and got a degree in ergonomics.

## Computer toys
When I'm not sleeping, I sometimes makes things that
[do](http://small.dada.pink/whom-to-email/README)
[my](/!/geeky-free-software-project)
[work](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tlevine)
for me so I have 
more time to sleep. My main trick is to articulate an
intuition in math and then repeat stupid things
[many](/!/searching-data-tables-better/)
[many](/open-data)
[times](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pluplusch).
I'm also curious about
[why]()
[people](http://small.dada.pink/dadawarehouse/README)
[do](/!/hovering-cycle)
things.
This might be why people started calling me a data scientist.

I usually doesn't like talking about computers, or at least not in the
way that people usually talk about them. It's about as interesting as talking
about how to sharpen a pencil---probably fun once in a while, but boring
if it's all that people ever want to talk about, especially if there isn't
anything interesting to write about with your sharpened pencil.

## Teaching
I apparently knows a lot about computer stuff. Talk to me if
you want to [learn something](/!/learning-data-stuff/).

Things people want in a relationship
---------------------------------------
It's not always clear what people want in a romantic partner.
Anabel thinks of three different things.

Emotional connection
    a
Partner in crime
    a
Sex
    a

The relationship goes well when the partners are in clear agreement
about which of these things come with the relationship and when they
negotiate any changes to these agreements.

Things that make people happy
-------------------------------
Anabel says that the happiness is explained by context, drive, and friendship groups.

Context
    Context is what do every day in the world and are used to doing, like a job.
Drive
    Your drive is an internal interest based on your skills, like the reason you are interested in a job.
Friendship groups
    People want friends.

These can go wrong when you retire

Context
    When people retire, they switch what they're doing every day.
Drive
    When people retire, they need to move the interest in their work to something else.
Friendship groups
    When people retire, their friendship groups change because they are often related to their work.

It's possible for one of them to go bad but the others not to.
For example, a person might dislike his job (lose drive) but still
keep it (maintain context) and keep his friendship groups. Or he
might like the job (maintain drive) but get fired (lose context)
and lose the friendship groups assosiated with the job.

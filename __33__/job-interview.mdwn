[[!meta description="Things I wonder about jobs"]]

Here are some questions that I find myself asking in the early stages
of job interviews. If you are interested in hiring me, please answer these
questions (or at least some of them) before we talk.

1. What's the job? (You don't have to tell me the company.)
2. What's the pay?
3. What's the process like for applying and interviewing?
   In particular, how much work will it be on my end?
4. Is part-time or consulting possible?
5. How much funding does the company have?
6. Is the company making a profit?

And here are some things that people almost always want to know.

* Here is a [resume](/!/cv/short/)
* You can read more about me at [thomaslevine.com](/).
* I'll relocate or travel for the right job.

People often wonder about whether I would take a full-time employee
job given that I have been doing freelance consulting for my whole career.

* I'm mainly doing consulting because I haven't found a normal job that
    would pay as well.
* In some cases, I would need a couple months before I could start working
    for you, and in other cases, I could start working tomorrow.
    (It is unlikely that it would be more than a couple months.)

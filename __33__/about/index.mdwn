I like to [sleep](/!/sleeping/), and I'm usually
curious about why people do anything else.
My favorite color is [pink](/img/me-420.png).

## History
Playing with computers since he was young,
I eventually developed back and
wrist pain, and then I started studying ergonomics.
My back and wrists now hurt less.

## Computer toys
When he isn't sleeping, I sometimes makes things that reduce work and give
me more time to sleep and socialize. My main trick is to articulate an
intuition in math and then repeat stupid things
[many](/!/searching-data-tables-better/)
[many](/open-data)
[times](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pluplusch).
This might be why people started calling me a data scientist.

I usually doesn't like talking about computers, or at least not in the
way that people usually talk about them. It's about as interesting as talking
about how to sharpen a pencil---probably fun once in a while, but boring
if it's all that people ever want to talk about, especially if there isn't
anything interesting to write about with your sharpened pencil.

## People
I seem to
[like](http://small.dada.pink/dadawarehouse/README)
[people](http://small.dada.pink/whom-to-email/README).

## Teaching
I apparently knows a lot about computer stuff. Talk to me if
you want to [learn something](/!/learning-data-stuff/).

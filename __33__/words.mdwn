## Words
I say "woah" a lot. Well, it's more like "wo-OH". I think this came from
Zarino Zappia.

The words "posh" and "bizarre" came from Annabel Church.

The word "particular" came from Freedom King, who used it frequently in
my statistics classes to distinguish one particular sampling unit from
another.

I don't know where "chainsaw" came from.

The intonation with which I say "data" (DAY-duh) might have come from
Ingrid Burrington.

I fell in love with having a second-person plural pronoun and thus picked
up "y'all" after a couple visits to cities in the southern United States.

## Other
I sometimes make a touch typing gesture while talking about a computer
thing, to indicate that the computer thing involves typing. This came
from David R. Jones.

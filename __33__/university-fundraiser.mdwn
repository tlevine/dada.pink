[[!meta title="A university fundraiser"]]

I once went to a fundraiser for a large American university.
It was hilarious.

The night consisted of artistic performances interspersed with
introductions of important people by other important people.

Did you know that all of this university's deans, trustees, &c.
are very "one-of-a-kind" and concerned with "excellence"?
They're also very "second-to-none", "creative", and otherwise
respectable. Oh and some of them donated a bunch of money, but
don't say that as loudly.

While all of the university's leadership is very best, only
the *female* dean is "graceful" and other feminine qualities.

And by donating your money to this wonderful, one-of-a-kind
school, you are saving the world! Watch the video of the happy
students who are pursuing their dreams and saving the world
because you are donating money towards their tuition. This
school is one-of-a-kind, and these students who don't have
money need to go to it in order to save the world, so when
you donate to their scholarships, you really are saving the world!

*I think that came off a bit more cynically than I actually
feel about this. It's mostly just fun to see how different
groups of people differ but are still mostly the same.*

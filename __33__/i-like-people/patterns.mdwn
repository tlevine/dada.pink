## Questions with implicit assumptions
Consider difference between the following questions.

1. Do you have a goal in life?
2. What is your goal in life?

The second question only makes sense if the answer to the first is "yes",
but someone may ask the second question without having confirmed that the
answer to the first question is "yes".

If someone asks a question of the second type without first asking a
question of the first type and I get an odd feeling about the way the question
is asked, it sometimes means that the person wants the answer to the first
question to be "yes".

### A person who asked about passions
I met someone who would ask people "What are are you passionate about?"
At the time, I mostly liked to sit around and not do much, and the word
"passion" didn't seem to fit. I told him something to that effect when
he asked me, (I probably said that I like to [sleep](/!/sleeping/).)
and he wound up teasing some sort of passion out of me. I think it had
something to do with saving the world, inspiring people, or being
enlightened, but I don't remember the details of the conversation.

Another time, this same person asked another person what she was passionate
about. She said that she wasn't passionate about anything, but she said it
in a soft (that is, not firm) way, and this first person insisted that she
wasn't giving herself enough credit and that she was surely passionate about
something.

Here are some things that might have been going on with this person who
would ask about peoples' passions and was very insistant that people had them.

* He thinks a lot about passions.
* He believes that he is passionate about something, or he wants to believe
    that he is passionate about something.
* He wants friends and needs some way of choosing which people to be friends
    with, (I want to write a few paragraphs about this and then link to it.)
    so he chooses to associate only with people who are passionate.
* He wants to have purpose in life, so he assigns purpose to the mundane
    things that he does. He looked like he was in his twenties, which I find
    to be the age where this phenomenon is strongest.
* You could describe him as being very passionate about changing the world
    for the better (in a particular way that I won't discuss), and you could
    also describe him as "homeless", "broke", and "unemployed". We might frown
    on him based on the latter description, so he exaggerates the former
    description.
* He wants to help people find their passions.

I find the above sorts of things to occur in people who ask questions with
strong assumptions, but it's not always that way. Often (usually?), the person
is just abbreviating the question that doesn't have strong assumptions
because that version is quite long.

### Every young professional ever
Lots of people ask, "What do you do?". In some circles, the question is
phrased as "Where are you from?", meaning which organization rather than
which country.

### The person's mental model
The person is expecting me to answer with a goal that sounds reasonable.
The odd feeling that I mention above is the feeling that I need to have a
goal in life. I may feel pressure to frame some stuff that I do as a goal
even if I don't think of myself as having a goal. On the other hand, I may
truly have a goal in life, in which case his expectation was right.

If I say in response that I don't have a goal in life, then I don't fit into
the person's mental model about goals. The person might try to resolve the
contradiction by deciding that one of the following statements is true.

* The person's model of the world is inadequete: Passions are not a
    meaningful way of categorizing people. (The person is least likely
    to resolve the contradiction this way.)
* People can be divided into those with passions and those without passions.
    People in the former group are *better*, and I am in the latter group.
* I really do have a passion, but I am being modest, being a wise-guy,
    under-selling myself, &c.

### Wanting to believe
If the person finds a way of preserving his mental model, the person is
showing that he really wants to believe in this model of the world.
Why might he want that? I can usually explain it as one of the following.

1. He or she has recently come up with a passion and is hoping that his
    strategy of coming up with a passion was a good idea.
2. He or she wants to fit in with a group of people who talk about their
    passions.

It is hard to know whether your mental model is right. (In this case, it's
hard to know whether having a passion is a good idea.) Also, it is scary
to be following a mental model that you don't know is right. Thus, people
sometimes try really hard to convince themselves that their mental models
are right.

##
* Brain settling, internal judgement
* Sudden, out-of-the-blue phrases are often opposite
    "It's not about the money."
  * When people are defensive about things they might collaborate with
* When people phrase things as people being defensive, it's a bit different maybe
* Person fits everything into a particular mental model
* Being very rational to avoid acknowledging feelings
* Shutting down verbally



## Beginning a thought with negation




## Beginning a thought with a very firm statement
Similar to the previous one

When I was in university, lots of people would ask me what my major
was. I'd say it was "ergonomics", and then I'd have to explain
[what ergonomics is]().
One day, I met someone whose major was math. I asked her what math
was and learned that it was "lies". And then I finally realized that
I should ask other people what their majors meant.

One day, I met someone whose major was political science, and I asked
him, just like I'd ask everyone else, what political science was.
He insisted right away that "It is a science!" and then justified that
the stuff he did in class was very scientific. I guess a lot of people
tell him that political science isn't a science. Moreover, I think he
wants to justify that he's doing something real.

## Immediate survival and comfort
Reasonable mysticism and unreasonable other things: Have you eaten?




## Unsolicited confirmation
People do this to convince themselves that they're going to do something
that they really want to do because they really want to do it but they
can't do it because there's something else that's more important.




## Exaggerations to fit in



## Forced speech
Sometimes, 

I recall finding myself in a circle of people where one person mentioned
that he had just quit his job and then everyone except me (literally)
applauded very loudly. That seemed a bit odd. I think that everyone either
had just quit his/her job or was considering quitting his/her job and was
looking for confirmation that he/she was making a good choice.

## Asking lots of questions

attention, recognition, &c.

## Intimate relationships
People in very close relationships (romance, certain business partnerships,
teacher-student relationships, parent-child relationships, &c.) can behave
quite differently from how they would around anyone else.
(Here's a somewhat [extreme and gruesome example](http://www.propublica.org/article/finding-oscar-massacre-memory-and-justice-in-guatemala).)
In such cases, it is often informative to consider the entire group to be
an atomic unit.

When someone gets upset about someone she or he is so close to, that person
is often upset at qualities of herself or himself that she or he sees in the
other person. Also, it is unlikely that one of the persons is being reasonable
and the other one being unreasonable; they are probably both being unreasonable.

Now is there an example that people would be okay with me sharing with the
internet....

## Specific interests

* Dermatologist with good visual memory
* Law student wants to work in comic books (because good and evil)
* Arguing about Palistine



I once conversed with someone who made a documentary about conflict in
Palestine. It was quite apparent that was so enthusiastic/angry about
it and that this was part of why she made the documentary. 


## Closing eyes or looking away
















Here are some possible examples

## Complaining about a particular deli not being a deli

* Not a deli
* Complaining a lot about that
* Thought experiments
  * If it weren't called a deli?
  * If it had deli food too
  * Parking situation
  * My brother and I like it, but dad doesn't.

And then it made sense!

## Violent agreement

* Arguing a lot
* Other times I had seen her, she didn't
* I mentioned this.
* I probably asked what was different. Like maybe she was stressed out about something else
* This is how you have to talk to programmers

After that conversation, I just laughed every time we started arguing
rather than thinking I was saying something wrong

## Programmers with bad social skills (dimensionality, money)

### Dimensions
I was talking with another person, and a third person came by.
Third person asks how many dimensions we have in our data.
Second person comments on the ability to expand one dimension
into many and on the arbitrariness of dimension counts.
(And I agree, but I don't say much.) It seemed like the third
person asked this question because he wanted to talk about
something else. (Men love to hear themselves talk.)
So I asked the third person why he was wondering about the dimensions.
(It isn't ordinary small talk, so there's probably a specific reason.)

It turns out that he is in graduate school and recently wrote a paper
on something related to the number of dimensions in your model. I don't
remember what he said, but it made sense when he said it.

### Money
I must have been especially patient that night. A few minutes later,

* talks aggressively
* likes to talk about neat things he did
* complains

money

* complaining related to economists
* the guy next to me had gone to graduate school for economics, and
    the money guy said that that was a bad economic decision in a
    somewhat condescending way
* money guy liked talking about how he bought an old car for cheap
    (more precisely, it was especially under-valued---cheap for even an old car)
* money guy lives in a subsidised apartment

I asked why he cares so much about money. He said money is how society
represents value and that if he's making lots of money he's doing good for
society (standard economic reasoning). Although this is the textbook economics,
a lot of people don't explain their actions thusly.

So I asked why he cares so much more about money than other people do.
I don't remember how I phrased it, but it probably was quite important
that I phrase it properly; if I hadn't been careful, I think it could have
been easy to take my question as an attack.

He said his parents were poor when he grew up and he decided he wanted to
make a million dollars by the time he was 30. And he did.

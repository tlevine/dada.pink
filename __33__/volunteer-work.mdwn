People talk of
[volunteer](http://okfn.org)
[open](http://www.planethunters.org/)
[openness](http://www.codeforamerica.org/)
[work](https://www.wikipedia.org/)
being bad because of the exploitation, overrepresentation of
overrepresented people, bad results, and any number of other things.

Surely this stuff has happened before!

I get the impression that this volunteer stuff is eventually done in a
more formal way, through things like
[Médecins Sans Frontières](http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org),
[Peace Corps](http://www.peacecorps.gov),
[Teach for America](http://www.teachforamerica.org/), and
[World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms (WWOOF)](http://www.wwoof.net/).

Are these the same sort of thing?

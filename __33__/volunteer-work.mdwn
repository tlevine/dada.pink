People talk of
[volunteer](http://okfn.org)
[open](http://openaddresses.io/)
[openness](http://www.codeforamerica.org/)
[work](https://www.wikipedia.org/)
being bad because of the exploitation, overrepresentation of
overrepresented people, bad results, lack of funding for things
that should be funded, alignment towards interests of rich
people, and any number of other things.

Surely this stuff has happened before!

I get the impression that this volunteer stuff is eventually done in a
more formal way, through things like
[Médecins Sans Frontières](http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org),
[Peace Corps](http://www.peacecorps.gov),
[Teach for America](http://www.teachforamerica.org/), and
[World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms (WWOOF)](http://www.wwoof.net/).

Are these the same sort of thing? If so, where can I find people who talk
about all of these things? If not, how are they different?

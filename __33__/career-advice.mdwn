## Why people give advice
Lots of people have no idea how to do what they want to do and want to
feel like they do know what they are doing. Giving advice can reassure
yourself that you are doing something reasonable. For example, if you
think that you should sleep a lot, you might suggest that other people
learn sleep a lot, in order to convince yourself that sleeping really
is a good idea.

Similarly, people often give advice in order to convince themselves that
they are experts. For example, you might give people career advice in
order to convince yourself that you know a lot about career stuff.

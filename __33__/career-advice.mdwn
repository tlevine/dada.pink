## Tom's career advice

### Pretending
Everyone is pretending that they belong in the real world

Most people are lying, so they probably won't call you out on a lie

### Be insulted when you are paid anything less than ridiculous wages
My wages have so much less to do with the work I provide than I

### Try to work as 

### Profit and greed are the least of motivations in business
People sometimes say that God says that we shouldn't kill each
other and still decide to go to Israel to fight a holy war. Similarly,
people sometimes say that they are in the business of making money and
then hire hip rockstar programmers so they can feel cool.

### Do real work for short terms rather than trying to find something that you enjoy and still pays

### Don't apply for jobs.

### The main reason you need "experience" is so you can feel confident when you're bullshitting.

## Other people's career advice may be totally irrelevant
The stuff I say above makes perfect sense to me, but other people think
it wouldn't apply to them. I suppose this is the bigger message you could
take from the present writing.

### Different backgrounds
People grew up in all different places, learned different things when they
were young, had different relationships with their families and other people,
have different genes, and so on. It's quite likely that the person giving
you advice was different enough that what he or she did won't always work for
you; moreover, it's not like we can know whether the advice will apply.

For example, some people are especially interested in making money. I find
that these people often came from relatively poor families and are hoping to
provide for their parents or for their (future) children.

### Career motivations change throughout life
Even a single person will have totally different career motivations throughout
her or his (or zir) life.

Various fancy people came up with ideas as to what motivates people.
I particularly like a way of thinking that we attribute to Erik Erikson,
mainly because his name is "Erik Erikson". His father left when he was
young, so he changed his name from "Erik [whatever-his-father's-last-name-was]"
to "Erik Erikson".

In this model, people are looking for eight different things throughout life.

1. Basic trust
2. ...



*I should note that I don't know whether Erik Erikson actually thought this
way; I haven't read much of his writings because they're too dense for me,
so this is just what I get from introductory psychology texts.*

### Why people give advice
Lots of people have no idea how to do what they want to do and want to
feel like they do know what they are doing. Giving advice can reassure
yourself that you are doing something reasonable. For example, if you
think that you should sleep a lot, you might suggest that other people
learn sleep a lot, in order to convince yourself that sleeping really
is a good idea.

Similarly, people often give advice in order to convince themselves that
they are experts. For example, you might give people career advice in
order to convince yourself that you know a lot about career stuff.

I quite enjoy saying outrageous things as if they're totally normal and
am also rather frustrated by how much of the advice I have been given is
totally irrelevant. My career advice [above](#tomscareeradvice) can be
summarized as "Tom used to believe common wisdoms, so he is surprised,
frustrated, and amused when he finds that they are totally wrong."

There are so many other reasons why people would give advice; my point
is that helping you out is the least of the reasons.
If someone is giving me advice, I usually see the advice as advice that
the other person is giving himself or herself (or zirself) rather than as
something that has anything to do with me.

## Conclusion
People have all different reasons why they work, and people come from
all different backgrounds, so it is quite likely that well meant advice
won't apply at all to you.

Lots of people have no idea how to do what they want to do and want to
feel like they do know what they are doing. Giving advice can reassure
yourself that you are doing something reasonable. For example, if you
think that you should learn Python, you might suggest that other people
learn Python, in order to convince yourself that learning Python really
is a good idea.

Similarly, people often give advice in order to convince themselves that
they are experts.

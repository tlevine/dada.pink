I want to run Tom's Computer School at your hackerspace or school or
wherever. Or maybe even over the internet, if we can't do in person.
Here's how it will work.

## How Tom thinks you should learn computers
I think you should do whatever you feel like and learn just enough
computer things as it seems relevant. Here are some related writings.

* Learn through ...

Tom can assist you in a few ways.

* Telling you what to learn (text editor, shell, ssh/scp/sftp, maybe a mail client)
* Explaining things that you couldn't find elsewhere

* Switching to command line
* Learning data stuff article

## Daily schedule
Each student will have a meeting of ten minutes with me. Students can
use this meeting to ask me questions. Since it's only ten minutes per
day, students are better off finding answers in other places if they
can, like from websites, books, and videos. This meeting will be a bit
different on the first day, as I discuss below.

### First day
As mentioned above, the ten-minute meetings will run a bit differently on
the first day.

If you have an idea of a computer thing that you want to make or learn,
we will discuss that thing, and I will tell you which aspects to do/learn
first, based on your background and what you want to do.


If you don't have much of an idea, I will decide for you, based on your
background and on the things that you do day to day. It will probably be one
of the following.

* Use vim or emacs for something that you already do with other software.
* Use the shell for something that you already do without the shell.
* Learn some

Given how involved these discussions may get, I will probably be okay with
them running beyond ten minutes.

You can, of course, ask for this sort of advice later in the school; I am
just deciding that this what we're going to talk about on the first day.

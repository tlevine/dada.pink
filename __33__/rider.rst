Sleeping
~~~~~~~~~
I'm quite flexible as to where I `sleep </!/sleeping>`_. For example,
here are some suitable places.

* In my own bed
* On the floor
* In a shared bed
* On the banister of a staircase

I'll need a blanket or radiator. I'm usually have soap and a towel
and a pillow, so I don't really need them. But they also can't hurt!

Washing
~~~~~~~~~
I'll be fine with my own laundry supplies, but the following
always makes things a bit easier.

* Laundry detergent
* Drying rack, fan, &c.
* A large tub/bowl

I have `few enough clothes </stuff/>`_ that I do laundry every couple
days (usually in a sink or bucket).

Not sleeping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If I'm snoring and that is keeping you up or otherwise bothering you,
wake me up, and I'll adjust pillows so I stop snoring.

Things
~~~~~~~~
I want to give away `CSV files </dada/print-formaldehide>`_.
Remind me if I forget.

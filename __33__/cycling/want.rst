Day bag
-----------
I want a front pannier that is easy to carry around without a bike
and has lots of pockets.

Tom Bihn Synapse 19
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I currently have a Tom Bihn Synapse 19. I can keep using it if I find
a way to mount it.
Regardless of whether I do this,
I'll keep using my Tom Bihn Synapse 19 for when I don't have a bike.

Backpack
~~~~~~~~~~~
`This <https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/19165/does-a-hybrid-pannier-backpack-exist>`_
is a good start on references. These look nice:

* `Mondi Backpack <http://www.newlooxs.nl/en/producten/rugzakken/mondi-backpack/5052/>`_
* `Side One <http://www.ortlieb.com/_prod.php?lang=en&produkt=racktime_sideone >`_and `Side Two](http://www.ortlieb.com/_prod.php?lang=en&produkt=racktime_sidetwo>`_
* `Ballard Market Pannier <http://www.detours.us/panniers/ballard-market-pannier.html>`_

For comparison of sizes, the Tom Bihn Synapse 19 has a volume of 19 liters,
or 1160 cubic inches. The Ribz Front Pack has like 12 litres.

Or maybe I just get a normal backpack and add the rack mounting things.
It's `pretty simple <http://www.instructables.com/id/Backpack-panniers-that-are-still-backpacks/.>`_
Here's a `crazier <http://moz.geek.nz/mozbike/ride/nz-2004/12-12-buller/nztour-buller-12-moz.html >`_approach.

Note: There isn't really a
`difference <http://www.bikeforums.net/touring/187734-difference-between-front-rear-panniers.html>`_
between front and rear panniers

Trunk bag
~~~~~~~~~~~
Trunk bags look pretty awesome.

* `Silkroad Pro <http://www.vaude.com/de-DE/Produkte/Taschen-Reisegepaeck/Silkroad-Plus-black.html>`_
* `MTX TrunkBag DX <http://bicyclehabitat.com/product/topeak-mtx-trunkbag-dx-46836-1.htm>`_
* `Hunchback <http://www.rei.com/product/847603/timbuk2-hunchback-rack-trunk#tab-specs>`_

These look cool but are too small for my laptop.

* `Interchange <http://bicyclehabitat.com/product/bontrager-interchange-rear-trunk-bag-179325-1.htm>`_
* `Banjo Brothers <http://banjobrothers.com/products/current/rack-top-bags/>`_

The `TailRider <http://www.arkel-od.com/us/all-categories/seat-bags-trunk-bags.html>`_
has a lot of heavy/annoying straps and stuff. Also, it fits only on a seatpost rack,
not on a rear wheel rack.

Separate from the physical differences, I like the idea of a trunk bag because
I don't have to change the bike configuration much depending on how I'm using the
bike; I always take the trunk bag with me, and I add panniers if I'm moving house.

It also pleases me aesthetically that they go in the center, so having only
one of them is weird.

I could also try mounting my Synapse this way.

Computers
----------------------
I can probably have some fun with computers. Maybe recording my acceleration,
altitude, global position, &c. could be fun. And maybe I could have some fun
with lights.

Lock
----------------------
The Kryptonite New York lock looks like the best.

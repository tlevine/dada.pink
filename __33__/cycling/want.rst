  that just fits my Tom Bihn Synapse 19 (16" x 11.4" x 7.9")
* `Bruce Gordon Front Mountain Rack <http://brucegordoncycles.bigcartel.com/product/front-mountain-rack>`_,
  because it's a fancy not-low-rider-but-similar rack that has a platform
  on top.

  * Kryptonite New York Lock Fahgettaboutit Mini U
  * Abus Locks U 54

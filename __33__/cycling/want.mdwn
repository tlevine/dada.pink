## Day bag
I want a front pannier that is easy to carry around without a bike
and has lots of pockets.

### Tom Bihn Synapse 19
I currently have a Tom Bihn Synapse 19. I can keep using it if I find
a way to mount it.
Regardless of whether I do this,
I'll keep using my Tom Bihn Synapse 19 for when I don't have a bike.

### Backpack
[This](https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/19165/does-a-hybrid-pannier-backpack-exist)
is a good start on references. These look nice:

* [Mondi Backpack](http://www.newlooxs.nl/en/producten/rugzakken/mondi-backpack/5052/)
* [Side One](http://www.ortlieb.com/_prod.php?lang=en&produkt=racktime_sideone) and [Side Two](http://www.ortlieb.com/_prod.php?lang=en&produkt=racktime_sidetwo)
* [Ballard Market Pannier](http://www.detours.us/panniers/ballard-market-pannier.html)

For comparison of sizes, the Tom Bihn Synapse 19 has a volume of 19 liters,
or 1160 cubic inches. The Ribz Front Pack has like 12 litres.

Or maybe I just get a normal backpack and add the rack mounting things.
It's [pretty simple](http://www.instructables.com/id/Backpack-panniers-that-are-still-backpacks/).
Here's a [crazier](http://moz.geek.nz/mozbike/ride/nz-2004/12-12-buller/nztour-buller-12-moz.html) approach.

Note: There isn't really a
[difference](http://www.bikeforums.net/touring/187734-difference-between-front-rear-panniers.html)
between front and rear panniers

### Trunk bag
Trunk bags look pretty awesome.

Separate from the physical differences, I like the idea of a trunk bag because
I don't have to change the bike configuration much depending on how I'm using the
bike; I always take the trunk bag with me, and I add panniers if I'm moving house.

It also pleases me aesthetically that they go in the center, so having only
one of them is weird.

I could also try mounting my Synapse this way.

## Computers
I can probably have some fun with computers. Maybe recording my acceleration,
altitude, global position, &c. could be fun. And maybe I could have some fun
with lights.

## Lock
The Kryptonite New York lock looks like the best.

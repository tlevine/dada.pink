I bought a bike! It's a 2010 Surly Long Haul Trucker that I found it on
Craigslist. And then I got assorted fancy bike toys.

I hadn't previously been into bikes and hadn't had a bike in 15 years,
but I got excited about bikes on Sunday, November 30, 2014.
While standing at a look-out place looking out over some pretty water
in Seattle, I got into a conversation with a person who was also there
and also with a bike. He said that highway 101 is a great place to bike
long distances and that there's camping along the way. This sounds fun.
I want to see pretty places and go camping without a car.

I also want to go to places in the United States, but most of them are
practically inaccessible by public transit, and public transit is usually
pretty unpleasant there.

I started looking at all sorts of cycling things on the internet and
compiled a [bunch of links](internet). I determined that I should get an
American bike because they're cheapest and that I should get a Surly
Long Haul Trucker, specifically. And then I checked Craigslist and
happened to find a good deal on one of those that fit me pretty well.
Woo!

Here are some [things I was thinking about getting](want) and have mostly
gotten. And here are some extended [notes on the wanting](want-notes).

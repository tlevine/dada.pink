I bought a bike! It's a 2010 Surly Long Haul Trucker that I found it on
Craigslist. And then I got assorted bike toys, including fancy panniers,
a fancy helmet, fancy lights, and fancy locks.

I hadn't previously been into bikes and hadn't had a bike in 15 years,
but I got excited about bikes on Sunday, November 30, 2014.
While standing at a look-out place looking out over some pretty water
in Seattle, I got into a conversation with a person who was also there
and also with a bike. He said that highway 101 is a great place to bike
long distances and that there's camping along the way. This sounds fun.
I want to see pretty places and go camping without a car.

I started looking at all sorts of cycling things on the internet and
compiled a [bunch of links](internet). I determined that I should get an
American bike because they're cheapest and that I should get a Surly
Long Haul Trucker, specifically. And then I checked Craigslist and
happened to find a good deal on one of those that fit me pretty well.
Woo!

But there are still a few things I [want](want), and some extended
[notes on the wanting](want-notes).

Day bag
-----------
I want a small pannier that is easy to carry around without a bike
and has lots of pockets.

Tom Bihn Synapse 19
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I currently have a Tom Bihn Synapse 19. I can keep using it if I find
a way to mount it.
Regardless of whether I do this,
I'll keep using my Tom Bihn Synapse 19 for when I don't have a bike.

How might I use it for the bike without converting it to a pannier bag?

Get a basket.

* Basket on a low-rider rack on the front wheel
* Single basket instead of a pannier on the back
* Handlebar basket
* Mount on top of the front rack
* I'd rather have it in front because I'll carry valuables in my backpack
  and will thus be bothered if I can't see it.

The basket should just-fit my Synapse (16" x 11.4" x 7.9"). Some options

* http://nantucketbikebaskets.com
  * `Cruiser Adult D-Shape, Pink <http://www.nantucketbikebaskets.com/index.php?page=shop.product_details&flypage=flypage.tpl&product_id=76&category_id=13&option=com_virtuemart&Itemid=3>`_

Attaching the backpack
(`biciconex.com <http://www.instructables.com/id/Backpack-on-a-Bike/?ALLSTEPS>`_).

* Loop the waist strap around the top of the rack, and then clip it.
* Tie the shoulder straps in front.
* Clip the top loop of the back pack to the top of the rack.
* Prevent it from getting caught in the wheels

  * Tie straps in a water knot so they don't flap around.
  * The rods that hold the rear fender in place should help.

Things I don't want to do.

* I don't want a basket, crate, &c. for the top of the rack?
  I'd rather not deal with having it and removing it for panniers and stuff.
* I am not going to trust bungee cords and cargo nets.

I think I'm going to wind up finding some sort of tray that isn't intended
to go on a bike and is of the perfect size to attach to my rack and to hold
the backpack's bottom straps. Then I'll add one bungee cord or something to
keep the backpack in place. And I'll put it on the front of the bike.

Backpack
~~~~~~~~~~~
These look nice.

* `Bug <http://www.arkel-od.com/us/all-categories/laptop-bicycle-pannier/bug-cummuting-bag.html>`_
* Arkel GT-18BP

These are almost nice.

* I can't tell what pockets the `Day PanPack <http://www.panpack.com/daypack.html>`_ has.
 
   * `Other PanPacks <http://www.panpack.com/product.html>`_

* `The Wave Backpack <http://www.newlooxs.nl/en/producten/rugzakken/the-wave-backpack/5381/>`_
  is a bit big.
* `Mondi Backpack <http://www.newlooxs.nl/en/producten/rugzakken/mondi-backpack/5052/>`_
  is nicely small but only has two pockets.

For comparison of sizes, the Tom Bihn Synapse 19 has a volume of 19 liters,
or 1160 cubic inches. The Ribz Front Pack has like 12 litres.

Or maybe I just get a normal backpack and add the rack mounting things.
It's `pretty simple <http://www.instructables.com/id/Backpack-panniers-that-are-still-backpacks/>`_.
Here's a `crazier <http://moz.geek.nz/mozbike/ride/nz-2004/12-12-buller/nztour-buller-12-moz.html>`_ approach.

Trunk bag
~~~~~~~~~~~
Trunk bags look pretty awesome.

* `Hunchback <http://www.rei.com/product/847603/timbuk2-hunchback-rack-trunk#tab-specs>`_

These look cool but are too small for my laptop.

* `Banjo Brothers <http://banjobrothers.com/products/current/rack-top-bags/>`_

The `TailRider <http://www.arkel-od.com/us/all-categories/seat-bags-trunk-bags.html>`_
has a lot of heavy/annoying straps and stuff. Also, it fits only on a seatpost rack,
not on a rear wheel rack.

Separate from the physical differences, I like the idea of a trunk bag because
I don't have to change the bike configuration much depending on how I'm using the
bike; I always take the trunk bag with me, and I add panniers if I'm moving house.

It also pleases me aesthetically that they go in the center, so having only
one of them is weird.

I could also try mounting my Synapse this way.

Computers
----------------------
I can probably have some fun with computers. Maybe recording my acceleration,
altitude, global position, &c. could be fun. And maybe I could have some fun
with lights.

Lock
----------------------
The Kryptonite New York lock looks like the best.

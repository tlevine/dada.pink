My favorite books
--------------------
Here are some of my favorite books. I have grouped them by topic,
where the "topics" are just words that people use a lot with some
vague idea of what they mean.

Anthropomentry
    Bodyspace
Everyday living
    Everyday Living for Girls
School, parenting, &c.
    Anything by Alfie Kohn
Reading books
    How to read a book, by someone Mortimer and someone
Love, dating, relationships, &c.
    Colours of Love
Usability
    Set phasers on Stun
Graphic Design
    Design Elements, Timothy Samara
Typography
    Designing with Type
Letterpress printing
    There was probably a really good one in the library....
Free software, free culture, freedom, &c.
    Anything by Richard Stallman
Life, &c.
    Just for Fun

Well, I don't quite know what I mean by "favorite", but I really
like all of these books, and I think that they're the ones you
should read if you're interested in the broader topics that I
have grouped them in.

Interesting books from a brainstorm with Anabel
---------------------------------------------------
Anabel and I somehow started talking about books, and this list came up.
I guess they're books that one of us liked or thought the other would like.

As you may have realized, I've recently been [studying](/open-data)
data about [open data](/!/what-is-open-data)
so that we can use data to drive our opening of
data. Because data. Data, data, data!

I want to keep doing this research all day.

## Things I can do for you
**If you work for a data-related software company**, I can prototype or implement new
features in your product to help your users find value in open data. This could involve
[identification of out-of-date data](/!/data-updatedness/) and
[new ways of searching for data](/!/openprism/).

**If you work for an organization that wants to release open data**
or share data internally, I can help you do that better.
By collecting data about your data, I can figure out what's working
and what isn't to help you decide what to do next. For example,
I can determine
[what sorts of data you have](/!/missouri-data-licensing/),
[whether your datasets are licensed properly](/!/open-data-licensing/), and
[how people are using your data](/!/socrata-users/).

**If you are giving grants in relation to open data**, we should talk.
I have a [long list](https://github.com/tlevine/open-data-things/tree/master/.plans/proposed)
of things that I want to do.

## Interested?
If you want any of the things above,
email me at [\_@thomaslevine.com](mailto:_@thomaslevine.com).

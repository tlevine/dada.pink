# Reading your (2012-2013) Scarsdale tax bill
Scarsdale's <a href="https://github.com/tlevine/scarsdale-data/blob/master/grandma/village.jpg">tax bills</a>
(and surely those of most governments) aren't
the most straightforward of documents. They've been this bad for
years, and I don't expect any change soon, so here's a guide for
reading them and a computerized tax bill simulator.

Your house is assessed to determine its Assessed Total Value, then
excemptions are subtracted to it to produce the Assessed Taxable Value.
This times the tax rate (in permil) produces your Tax Amount.

If you add up the county, village and school tax rates, it comes to about
$1,000, so your tax payments are about equal to the assessed value of your
house. There are also the sewer and solid waste taxes, but those are much
smaller.

Enter the assessed taxable value of your house to find out what you pay in
taxes and how you compare to everyone else. You can find your house's
assessed total and taxable values <a href="https://github.com/tlevine/scarsdale-data/blob/master/assessor/2012.pdf?raw=true">here</a>.

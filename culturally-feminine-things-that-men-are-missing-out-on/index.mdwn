# Four culturally feminine things that men are missing out on
If you're male, you might be glad not to have to deal with many
unpleasant culturally female things, like cat-calling and restricted career
opportunities. On the other hand, you're missing out on a lot of culturally
feminine awesome.

## 1. Leggings

I'm excited when fall comes around because it means I can start
wearing all of my winter clothes&mdash;fuzzy sweaters,
my pink hat, and, of course, leggings! They're warm and cosy, and
they don't restrict my legs.

Because of social conventions, I only wear these around the house
and while belly dancing. Well, I might wear also them under long
pants if it's really cold out, but that's not really the same thing.

## 2. Nail polish

I had no idea how fun it would be to paint my nails. I paint them
pink, of course. I only do my toes so that I can cover them when
I'm around people who wouldn't want to see a man with painted nails.

## 3. Burquas

It was a bit shocking how amazing it felt the first time I tried a burqua.
When I'm all covered up, I don't have to worry about whether I look
okay. In particular, I can relax about how people are going to interpret
my facial expressions, because they're not going to see them at all.

I originally got an abaya and a hijab to wear to
[drag parties](/!/burqua/) in
college, and it turns out that such full-body coverings are particularly
well suited to dance parties. By covering my whole body, they shielded me
from the sweaty drunk people who are all too common in college parties.
Also, because the abaya is very flowy and loose-fitting, I can fan myself
with it when I get too hot. And the way it moves while I dance is really neat.

This sort of clothing has a special cultural significance that I don't
really understand. I have read that its various connotations make it
difficult for even women to wear, in certain countries. Also, I hear
that women who don't want to wear them are sometimes required to anyway.

So men aren't the only ones who are missing out!

## 4. Belly dancing

Belly dancing feels so amazing! You might be surprised to learn that
this dance really doesn't have anything to do with the belly; it uses
all parts of the body and involves movements that I had no
idea were possible.

It always seems like everyone doing computer stuff is a 25-year-old
prodigy who is changing the world in the most important way possible.
It took me a while to realize this because everyone's really good at
pretending that he knows what he's doing. But once I realized that,
I started wondering why this is. And here are my conclusions.

Especially at this age, people want to feel like they have a place
in society. You might call this "identity crisis".
Having an important job or being in school is a pretty
easy way to feel like you're playing a part in society,
so people dedicate their lives to silly things that don't pay.

And it works! Sort of. You play an important part within the
company, non-profit organization, school, free software bazaar, &c.,
and you feel like the organization is contributing to an larger
thing that is important to broader society.

It's really cool what happens when I think like this.
At a very practical level, it starts to make sense
why people start businesses or make bad business decisions.
It's also quite relaxing. When it looks like everyone around you
is doing way more important things than you are, it's worth considering
that they aren't really doing way more important things; they might just
be pretending. And 

More generally, it's nice to think about why people act the way they do.

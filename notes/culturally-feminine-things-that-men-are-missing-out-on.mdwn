## 1. Belly dancing

Belly dancing feels so amazing! Despite its name, the dance really
includes all parts of the body and involves movements that I had no
idea were possible.

## 2. Leggings

I'm excited when fall comes around because it means I can start
wearing all of my winter clothes---fuzzy sweaters,
my pink hat, and, of course, leggings! They're warm and cosy, and
they don't restrict my legs.

Because of social conventions, I only wear these around the house
and while belly dancing. Well, I might wear also them under long
pants if it's really cold out, but that's not really the same thing.

## 3. Nail polish

I had no idea how fun it would be to paint my nails. I paint them
pink, of course. I only do my toes so that I can cover them when
I'm around people who wouldn't want to see a man with painted nails.

## 4. Skirts

Skirts are so much better than pants. They're easier to fit, they're
not restrictive at all, and they're much nicer for warm weather.
They're also fun for belly dancing.

## 5. Burquas

It was a bit shocking how amazing it felt the first time I tried a burqua.
When I'm all covered up, I don't have to worry about whether I look
okay. In particular, I can relax about how people are going to interpret
my facial expressions, because they're not going to see them at all.

I originally got an abaya and a hijab to wear to
[drag parties](/!/burqua/) in
college, and it turns out that such full-body coverings are particularly
well suited to dance parties. By covering my whole body, they shielded me
from the sweaty drunk people who are all too common in college parties.
Also, because the abaya is very flowy and loose-fitting, I can fan myself
with it when I get too hot. And the way it moves while I dance is really neat.

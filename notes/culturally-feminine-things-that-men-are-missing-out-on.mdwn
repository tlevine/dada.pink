## 1. Belly dancing
![Tom belly dancing]()

Belly dancing feels so amazing! Despite its name, the dance really
includes all parts of the body and involves movements that I had no
idea were possible.

## 2. Leggings

I'm excited when fall comes around because it means I can start
wearing all of my winter clothes---fuzzy sweaters,
my pink hat, and, of course, leggings! They're warm and cosy, and
they don't restrict my legs.

Because of social conventions, I only wear these around the house
and while belly dancing. Well, I might wear also them under long
pants if it's really cold out, but that's not really the same thing.

## 3. Nail polish

I had no idea how fun it would be to paint my nails. I paint them
pink, of course. I only do my toes so that I can cover them when
I'm around people who wouldn't want to see a man with painted nails.

## 4. Skirts

I've seen several discussions of data science (and otherwise computerly)
"war stories", such as
this
this and
that.

"*War* stories"? *Really*? On one hand, you don't really mean that data science
and computer stuff is like war, but talking about it this way elevating it to
a noble sacrifice of a job where you're fighting for the good of the people.
Compared to warring, computering means less work, more pay, lower risk of
death, and maybe more prestige. Also, it's not your duty to your country or
anything; nominally, you're just trying to make money for your company.

Having said all this, I'm starting to wonder whether warring is the noble
sacrifice that I'm elevating it to.... That's another story.

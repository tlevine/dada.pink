People are reacting suddenly and gradually making a big deal out of something
that and getting stressed about sort of nothing. I step in and spiral it out
of control in order to point tihs out.

This could be an argument or a very directed/scripted/normative conversation.

I approach with naive ignorance.

Let's distinguish between the people who are involved in the discussion and
those who aren't. In the argument case (like the politics within my university
dorm or within the team in a project I worked on), the people involved in the
discussion are the people in the two groups who are arguing; the other group
is all the people who are aware of the politics but aren't noticably arguing.
In the case of the normative conversation, there are the people who

 everyone else, who isn't arguing. In the non-argument
In the former, it's like there are two arguing groups. This would be like the
Risley mailing list or like workplace politics.

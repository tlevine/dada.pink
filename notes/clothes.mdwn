Before considering whether I like how clothes look, I evaluate
clothes with several much simpler criteria.

## Material


## Color
The color has to go with pink. Neutral colors are quite good,
as are certain blues and yellows.

I particularly like using pink as an accent color. For example,
gloves, buttons on a shirt, and small sections of pink are all
good. Large patches of pink are good if they include multiple
pinks. For example, strips of different pinks or of pink and
white are good. Large patches of pink are also okay if they have
an interesting texture, such a knit. On the other hand,
I probably won't consider a shirt of all the same pink.

## Type-specific preferences
Here are some criteria specific to clothing types.

### Shirt
My American shirt size is small. I usually wear size small, and I
rarely consider wearing size medium. I don't think I ever consider
shirts of other sizes.

Also, I wear only long-sleeved shirts.

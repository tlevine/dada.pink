[[!meta title="My to-do list"]]
[[!meta description="How I keep track of things to do"]]

Rather than keeping track of all of the things you want to do,
I remove things from my to-do list before my do them; this way,
I don't have to do them!

## Deconstructing
Well I still do some of the things, but only if they're short
and easy. Or I break bigger things into smaller things, remove
most of the smaller things, and then do one or two of the
smaller things. And then I sleep.

## Software
I store these things-to-do in a
[file](http://small.dada.pink/schedule/to-do.pal)
in a [git](http://git-scm.com) repository,
and I edit the file with
[pal](http://palcal.sourceforge.net/).
When I don't want to do things, I delete them! Or I move them
to the
"[postponed](http://small.dada.pink/schedule/postponed.pal)"
file if I feel attached to them. Either way, they're saved in
the git history, so I can always find them if I really want.

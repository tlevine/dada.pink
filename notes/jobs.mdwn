People wonder whether I want a real job as my consulting seems to be
going fine, so I have comment that doesn't fit into your six-thing
structure.

I only take work that pays decently, and I don't apply for jobs, and
this substantially limits my pool of potential work. The work that
finds its way to me tends to be short-term consulting.

I don't apply for jobs because it is a lot of work and because it is
rarely clear what job I have applied for until after I have started
the job. Also, I am especially reluctant to apply when I don't know
what the salary is because the salary usually winds up being disappointing.

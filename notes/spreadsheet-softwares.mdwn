Gnumeric's Python plugin stuff is a bit less documented
and functioning than I had hoped, so I'm considering
switching [sheetmusic](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sheetmusic)
to something other than Gnumeric.

One possibility is to use Gnumeric with a different language
plugin, but I felt like Python's documentation was among the
best in Gnumeric, and I'm still concerned that the bugs will be
a bit common; I get the feeling that people just don't write
very many Gnumeric functions in Python.

I narrowed down
[this list of spreadsheet software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_spreadsheet_software#Free_and_Open_Source_Software)
to things that support custom functions and are still being
developed; I came up with [Calligra Sheets](http://www.calligra.org/sheets/)
I had even more trouble with LibreOffice, so I don't want to use that.

[Org mode](http://orgmode.org/) has spreadsheets, and that has to be pretty
easy to program. I looked at a few others.

[These](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22931622/vim-like-command-line-spreadsheet-sc-how-do-you-deal-with-the-lack-of-undo-fea)
[pages](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/24245/command-line-friendly-spreadsheets)
got me to the following programs.

* [sc](http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/10699)
* [oleo](http://www.gnu.org/software/oleo/doc/oleo.html)
* [slsc](ftp://space.mit.edu/pub/davis/slsc/)
* [vim-orgmode](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3642)
* [spreadsheet.vim](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=558)

Searching around, I came up with some JavaScript spreadsheets.

* [SlickGrid](https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid/) looks like just
    a grid, but I can check the
    [used-by page](https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid/wiki/Used-by)
    for a spreadsheet program.
* [dhtmlxSpreadsheet](http://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/dhtmlxSpreadsheet/)
* [jQuery.sheet](http://roberto.open-lab.com/2010/01/30/javascript-grid-editor-i-want-to-be-excel/)

[This page](http://linuxfinances.info/info/spreadsheetsfree.html) is awesome.
Ideas from there include

* [xspread](http://www.chemie.fu-berlin.de/chemnet/use/xspread.html)
* [History of spreadsheets](http://linuxfinances.info/info/spreadsheets.html)
* [SS](http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/url.cgi?ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/FreeBSD-current/ports/math/ss/pkg/DESCR)
* [Abacus](http://kdbio.inesc-id.pt/~aml/abacus/abacus.html)
* [Esheet](http://esheet.sourceforge.net/)
* [Dismal mode](http://ritter.ist.psu.edu/dismal/dismal.html)
* [Teapot](http://www.syntax-k.de/projekte/teapot/) looks super awesome,
    but extensions need to be written in C. :(

A side note, "teapot" refers to some widely different programs. ::

    $ yaourt teapot
    1 aur/teapot 2.3.0-2 (28)
        Table Editor and Planner.  A 3D curses based spreadsheet for mathy people.
    2 aur/teapotnet-git 20140211-1 (3)
        Private and decentralized social network for file sharing and streaming
    3 aur/teapotviewer 0.2.6.0-5 (5)
        An Open Source third party viewers for Second Life® (secondlife) and OpenSim (opensimulator) 
        grids.

## Most promising
I think these are the most promising.

* Calligra
* sc
* Dismal mode
* Esheet

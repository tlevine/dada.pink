I want to retire. What do I need to do in order for that to happen?

My present expenses
=========================
My yearly expenses are approximately as follows (early 2014).

.. csv-table::

    Thing,Yearly expense
    Places to sleep,"$13,000"
    "Planes, trains, buses, &c.","$3,000"
    Computers,"$2,000"
    Everything else,"$5,000"

Let's round the total to $25,000. 

The sleep and travel expenses will
probably go down very soon (because I have been traveling `a lot </stuff>`_
and am getting tired of it and because I am getting tired of big cities),
but other things might replace them. And I might need more if I have kids.

If I don't save up lots of money at once
=========================================
At present, I work very little and still save more (after taxes) than
I spend; in a sense, I am already retired. If I knew that I would be able
to find one project that paid decently every year, I would be able to cover
the aforementioned expenses with one or two months of work per year.

I kind of like this approach more. First, I think that spreading work across
a long period of time would be less stressful. Second, the structure of taxes
in most countries encourage making less money rather than making more money.
And finally, I generally prefer the slow approaches to things.

But I don't like this approach because I don't want to count on being able
to find work that pays this well in 20 years. I see too many people who did
computer stuff 20 years ago and can't find work anymore. And the ones who
can find work have to stay on top of career things, so it doesn't seem as
much like retirement.

If I save up lots of money at once
====================================
How much do I need to save if I save up lots of money at once?
I ran `FIRECalc <http://firecalc.com/>`_ with different starting
portfolio amounts and different spending rates. This simulates
the performance of stock market portfolios for different 70-year
periods and guesses whether the portfolio amount will be enough
to retire for 70 years.

.. csv-table::

    Spending rate,Starting money,Success rate
    "$15,000","$400,000",:sup:`4`\ ⁄\ :sub:`5`
    "$15,000","$500,000",100%
    "$20,000","$400,000",:sup:`2`\ ⁄\ :sub:`5`
    "$20,000","$500,000",:sup:`4`\ ⁄\ :sub:`5`
    "$20,000","$600,000",98%
    "$25,000","$400,000",:sup:`1`\ ⁄\ :sub:`2`
    "$25,000","$500,000",:sup:`2`\ ⁄\ :sub:`5`
    "$25,000","$600,000",:sup:`4`\ ⁄\ :sub:`5`
    "$25,000","$700,000",95%
    "$35,000","$600,000",:sup:`1`\ ⁄\ :sub:`3`
    "$35,000","$800,000",:sup:`2`\ ⁄\ :sub:`3`
    "$35,000","$1,000,000",97%

How much money I'd need to make
---------------------------------
My present savings (2014) are about $200,000. Half of this is the
money that my parents saved for my university and I didn't use,
the other half is money that I have saved since university.


Job things
====================================
I'm thinking about all this stuff right now because I have been
thinking about getting a real job lately. I have lately been getting
the feeling that I want a normal job in a big, insular company in
a town that isn't especially well known. I feel like this would relax
me a lot.

* I'd stress less about money if I made more money.
* Smaller towns are less stressful.
* I'm curious about what it's like in these companies.

Anyway, I'm thinking about this now to see how long I would want to
work for one of those companies if I only cared about retiring. After that,
I might keep working in such work, or I might not.






Let's assume optimistically that I'm going to live until 94 (70 years),
I have about $200,000 in savings, and that's about eight years of
expenses. Let's round this to ten years and figure that I only have
to take care of 60 years. At my present rate, it'll take 20 or 30
years to save up that much money, and I don't feel like waiting that
long.

Note well: I'm ignoring inflation and instead doing all these calculations
in same-time currency. Also, interest will help a tiny bit, but I'm
ignoring it too to make the calculations easier.

## Removing housing expenses
If I remove housing expenses, my expenses go down to about $10,000,
so one year of work yields five to ten years of retirement. Also,
my present expenses would be worth 20 years. Thus, I would get five
to ten years of retirement for every year of work.

## Semi-retirment
I'll feel more comfortable not working if I have lots of savings,
but it's sort of silly to try to save up everything at once.

### Kids and stuff
I haven't looked at all into what it costs to raise a child, but I
figure that it's on the order of what it costs to raise an adult.
Let's figure that I get married and hawe two kids. If the hypothetical
partner and I contribute equal funds, I'll have to pay for two people
(me and a kid) instead of just one.

This makes the necessary retirement funds a lot higher, and maybe
I don't feel like waiting that long.

### Making money slowly
I'll feel more comfortable retiring with lots of savings, but it
kind of makes more sense for tax reasons to make money slowly. If
I make something more like $30,000 per year, my taxes will be a lot
lower; I could do much less work this way, but it means that I'll
have to hope that this data bubble doesn't burst too badly.

### Retirement savings accounts
There are some tax benefits associated with putting things into
accounts that I can't access until I'm 65, so it's worth saving
just enough money to live until I'm 65 and then to use those accounts
for after.

## Some strategies
Let's keep things small and say that I only want for now to save
enough money to live until I'm 64; figure that I'll make enough
by then to live the rest of life.

If I keep spending as much as I am, I need to make (not save)
$800,000 (40 years at $25,000/year), in addition to my present $200,000.
For example, I need to work for eight years at $100,000 or four years at $200,000.

If I find a way to substantially reduce my housing expenses such that
my yearly expenses go down to $10,000, I need to make an additional $200,000,
on top of my present $200,000. This is one year at $200,000, for example.

One possibility is to keep my expenses high while making money and then
to lower them once I've saved enough money. For example, I could maintain
my present extravagent expenses while working, and then I could focus on
reducing my housing expnses once I save a little money.

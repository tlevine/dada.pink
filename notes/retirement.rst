I want to retire. What do I need to do in order for that to happen?

## Long estimate
My yearly expenses seem to be approximately as follows. (Check it.)

    Thing,Yearly expense
    Places to sleep,"$13,000"
    "Planes, trains, buses, &c.","$3,000"
    Computers,"$2,000"
    Everything else,"$5,000"

Let's round the total to $25,000.

Also, my yearly income on the
order of $64,000 to $128,000. Figuring that a third of that goes to
taxes, I save something on the order of $25,000 to $50,000 per year.
Thus, for every year that I work, I can retire for one or two years.

Let's assume optimistically that I'm going to live until 94 (70 years),
I have about $200,000 in savings, and that's about eight years of
expenses. Let's round this to ten years and figure that I only have
to take care of 60 years. At my present rate, it'll take 20 or 30
years to save up that much money, and I don't feel like waiting that
long.

Note well: I'm ignoring inflation and instead doing all these calculations
in same-time currency. Also, interest will help a tiny bit, but I'm
ignoring it too to make the calculations easier.

## Removing housing expenses
If I remove housing expenses, my expenses go down to about $10,000,
so one year of work yields five to ten years of retirement. Also,
my present expenses would be worth 20 years. Thus, I would get five
to ten years of retirement for every year of work.

## Semi-retirment
I'll feel more comfortable not working if I have lots of savings,
but it's sort of silly to try to save up everything at once.

### Kids and stuff
I haven't looked at all into what it costs to raise a child, but I
figure that it's on the order of what it costs to raise an adult.
Let's figure that I get married and hawe two kids. If the hypothetical
partner and I contribute equal funds, I'll have to pay for two people
(me and a kid) instead of just one.

This makes the necessary retirement funds a lot higher, and maybe
I don't feel like waiting that long.

### Making money slowly
I'll feel more comfortable retiring with lots of savings, but it
kind of makes more sense for tax reasons to make money slowly. If
I make something more like $30,000 per year, my taxes will be a lot
lower; I could do much less work this way, but it means that I'll
have to hope that this data bubble doesn't burst too badly.

### Retirement savings accounts
There are some tax benefits associated with putting things into
accounts that I can't access until I'm 65, so it's worth saving
just enough money to live until I'm 65 and then to use those accounts
for after.

## Some strategies
Let's keep things small and say that I only want for now to save
enough money to live until I'm 64; figure that I'll make enough
by then to live the rest of life.

If I keep spending as much as I am, I need to make (not save)
$800,000 (40 years at $25,000/year), in addition to my present $200,000.
For example, I need to work for eight years at $100,000 or four years at $200,000.

If I find a way to substantially reduce my housing expenses such that
my yearly expenses go down to $10,000, I need to make an additional $200,000,
on top of my present $200,000. This is one year at $200,000, for example.

One possibility is to keep my expenses high while making money and then
to lower them once I've saved enough money. For example, I could maintain
my present extravagent expenses while working, and then I could focus on
reducing my housing expnses once I save a little money.

I want to retire. What do I need to do in order for that to happen?

My present expenses
=========================
My yearly expenses are approximately as follows (early 2014).

.. csv-table::

    Thing,Yearly expense
    Places to sleep,"$13,000"
    "Planes, trains, buses, &c.","$3,000"
    Computers,"$2,000"
    Everything else,"$5,000"

Let's round the total to $25,000. 

The sleeping expenses will probably go down soon as I am getting tired of
big cities.

Also, I have gotten `good at traveling </stuff>`_, so I expect some of the
sleeping expenses to be replaced with travel expenses.

On the other hand, other expenses will increase. I expect that my expenses
would decrease overall if I stopped trying to make money because I would
have more time to reduce my expenses. The most notable increase would be if
I decided to have a kid. (I haven't looked into what that costs, but I figure
it would approximately double my expenses.)

If I don't save up lots of money at once
=========================================
At present, I work very little and still save more (after taxes) than
I spend; in a sense, I am already retired. If I knew that I would be able
to find one project that paid decently every year, I would be able to cover
the aforementioned expenses with one or two months of work per year.

I kind of like this approach more. First, I think that spreading work across
a long period of time would be less stressful. Second, the structure of taxes
in most countries encourage making less money rather than making more money.
And finally, I generally prefer the slow approaches to things.

But I don't like this approach because I don't want to count on being able
to find work that pays this well in 20 years. I see too many people who did
computer stuff 20 years ago and can't find work anymore. And the ones who
can find work have to stay on top of career things, so it doesn't seem as
much like retirement.

If I save up lots of money at once
====================================
How much do I need to save if I save up lots of money at once?
I ran `FIRECalc <http://firecalc.com/>`_ with different starting
portfolio amounts and different spending rates. This simulates
the performance of stock market portfolios for different 70-year
periods and guesses whether the portfolio amount will be enough
to retire for 70 years.

.. csv-table::

    Spending rate,Starting money,Success rate
    "$15,000","$400,000",:sup:`4`\ ⁄\ :sub:`5`
    "$15,000","$500,000",100%
    "$20,000","$400,000",:sup:`2`\ ⁄\ :sub:`5`
    "$20,000","$500,000",:sup:`4`\ ⁄\ :sub:`5`
    "$20,000","$600,000",98%
    "$25,000","$400,000",:sup:`1`\ ⁄\ :sub:`2`
    "$25,000","$500,000",:sup:`2`\ ⁄\ :sub:`5`
    "$25,000","$600,000",:sup:`4`\ ⁄\ :sub:`5`
    "$25,000","$700,000",95%
    "$35,000","$600,000",:sup:`1`\ ⁄\ :sub:`3`
    "$35,000","$800,000",:sup:`2`\ ⁄\ :sub:`3`
    "$35,000","$1,000,000",97%

My present savings (2014) are about $200,000. Half of this is the
money that my parents saved for my university and I didn't use,
the other half is money that I have saved since university.

Let's figure that I take a job that pays $150,000 per year. After
taxes, this is about $100,000 per year. Let's figure further that
I would increase my expenses a bit because I'd have to focus more
on work and that I would save about $66,667 per year. I would have
$400,000 after three years and $600,000 after six years. But I don't
think I could last that long.

More optimistically, if I get a job that pays a bit higher, I don't
increase my expenses, and I am not horrible with taxes, I might save
more like $100,000 per year. In this case, I would need two years to
get to $400,000 and four years to get to $600,000. Two to four years
sounds more like something I could handle.

The above two estimates are for having enough money to spend about
$25,000 per year; if I wanted to have enough money to spend $35,000
per year, I'd need to work for up to ten years.

I doubt that I would make all of the money up-front like this; I'll
probably make some money this way when an appealing job arises and then
go back to my present situation afterwards. I did this to see whether
taking a real job would help much, and it seems that it would.

Job things
====================================
One reason I'm thinking about all this stuff right now is that I have been
thinking about getting a real job lately. I have lately been getting
the feeling that I want a normal job in a big, insular company in
a town that isn't especially well known. I feel like this would relax
me a lot.

* I'd stress less about money if I made more money.
* Smaller towns are less stressful.
* I'm curious about what it's like in these companies.

Anyway, I'm thinking about this now to see how long I would want to
work for one of those companies if I only cared about retiring. After that,
I might keep working in such work, or I might not.




Things I ignored
==================

Retirement savings accounts
-------------------------------
There are some tax benefits associated with putting things into
accounts that I can't access until I'm 65, so it's worth saving
just enough money to live until I'm 65 and then to use those accounts
for after.

Housing expenses
-------------------
If I find a way to substantially reduce my housing expenses, I need a
lot less money. The most likely way I see myself doing this is purchasing
some form of real estate in a cheap place. I figure that this could
reduce my housing expenses to something more like $6,000.

More importantly, the marginal cost of a kid would probably be much lower
as I would probably wind up with a bigger house or apartment than I would
get in a city. With this occurrence and some other reductions in expenses,
$25,000 per year might wind up being enough to raise a kid.

Life things
===================

Job
-------
I think that my preference in jobs is all about retiring. Either I want a
job that pays a lot so I'll have enough money in four years, or I want a
job that is very little work so I can stay in the semi-retirement that I'm
in now. (I'd also do a job that I actually like and pays better than
terribly, but I think those are hard enough to find that it's not worth
looking for them.)

Family
---------
I noted a few years ago that I enjoy home economics and ergonomics; that
I'd be okay with having spent so long studying ergonomics if the only thing
that came of it all was me having a nice house; and that I'd really like
to be a housewife.

I have recently been predicting that I'll want kids once I'm settled and
married and whatnot. But it's hard to predict, and I don't want kids now,
so that might also not happen.

Interestingly enough, if I take a job in a year, work for four years, and
then leave, I'll be at an age when people have kids. Hmm.

That would be an interesting version of retirement.

Relax
-------
Every time I do this sort of calculation, I realize that I don't need to
worry about money as much as I do. I think it's quite safe for me to
keep my expenses high while making money and then to lower them once I've
saved enough money.

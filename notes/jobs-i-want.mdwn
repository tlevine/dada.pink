I think most of my preferences regarding work relate to me
wanting to [retire]().

When I think of retirement, I'm thinking that I don't work
or that I don't plan what I work on. (These are different
phrasings of the same thing.)

Here I discuss the preferences that follow from this desire.

## Good pay

## Little work
Because I haven't found much work that pays well enough to excite me,
you could say that I am semi-retired right now. Even if the pay isn't
great, I'll take short-term or part-time work as long as the application
process isn't very involved.

## "Research", "Art", &c.
I remarked last year that my life was kind of like that of a professor
in a research position. The stuff that I do for fun could be described
as things like "research" and "art", so it is possible that a job of this
sort would appeal to me.

That said, I determined a couple years ago that it was easier to do work
that pays and have time for fun things is than it is to find a job that
I like doing, so I am skeptical that this is a reasonable sort of job for
me to look for.

## Location

Hmm the money might actually be more complicated than I made it sound.
I think my list of things came out oddly because it is based more on
the jobs that I have had than the jobs that I haven't.

Here's the thing that prompts me to consider real jobs. I have lately
been thinking that I want a normal job at a big, insular company in a
place that isn't a big city. I think that I haven't come across this
because I haven't looked, because that is a lot of work. And I suspect
people in these companies don't look for people like me because that
is a lot of work. But recruiters help with that.

In big cities in the United States, where all of my work has been,
I would start to consider taking a full-time job if it paid at least
$170,000. It could be less if it has good benefits or if "full time"
is actually full time rather than overtime.

Smaller cities are appealing
I could also go for less
if it is in a smaller
city. (Smaller cities are cheaper, and I can't take the noise of loud
cities.)

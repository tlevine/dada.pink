# Plotting data as music videos in R
[UseR! 2015](http://user2015.math.aau.dk/contributed_talks#61)

## The promise of music videos
Let's talk about why we plot data. Data are abstract numbers that
become meaningful to us only when we can perceive them.

We typically map the data to visuals, and we call this process
"data visualization".

In order that our visualizations can reveal unexpected patterns,
it is important that we present many dimensions at once.

Also, data are much more complex than they were in the past, so we
increasingly need to represent highly complex datasets. There is only
so much big data that we can fit in a visualization.

We can apply a model to reduce the data to something more manageable,
but when we do this, we lose the opportunity to analyze the raw variables.

I have been trying to use our non-visual senses to increase our sensory
bandwidth.

### If you are going to make data music videos, R is a good tool.

1. Vector graphics (for video)
2. Optimized matrix operations (for music)
3. Integrations with many standard data stores

## How to make music videos in R
I hope I have convinced you that data music videos are promising
enough that you'll at least watch me show you how to make them in R.
I'm going to show you how to make video, how to make music, and how
to combine the two.

1. Video
2. Music
3. Combining them

If you want to make data music videos, you also need to get your data
into R. I'm not going to talk about that today.


## Why this matters

### The business case
If you have a particularly complex and difficult dataset, data music
videos might give you a good and fast return on investment.
But the tools for this aren't fully developed and stable, so I can't
recommend it in general.

### Stop limiting yourself to "visualization"
You can still draw some useful inspiration from data music.
I am amused that this talk was included in the "visualization" track.

It's about plotting, converting data from abstract to concrete
metaphors...
we have to find the meaningful representation, and that's about
leveraging our existing intuitions; there's nothing specifically
visual about it.

I think we started out calling this stuff "visualization" because
it's easier to record and read visual things like books rather than
things with other senses, like smell....

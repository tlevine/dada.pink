# Plotting data as music videos in R
[UseR! 2015](http://user2015.math.aau.dk/contributed_talks#61)

## The promise of music videos
Let's talk about why we plot data. Data are abstract numbers that
become meaningful to us only when we can perceive them.

We typically map the data to visuals, and we call this process
"data visualization".

In order that our visualizations can reveal unexpected patterns,
it is important that we present many dimensions at once.

> Escaping flatland

Also, data are much more complex than they were in the past, so we
increasingly need to represent highly complex datasets. There is only
so much big data that we can fit in a visualization.

We can apply a model to reduce the data to something more manageable,
but when we do this, we lose the opportunity to analyze the raw variables.

So this doesn't fix the problem; if we want to represent more
variables in their original form, we need more bandwidth.

I have been trying to use our non-visual senses to increase our sensory
bandwidth.

(Explain the video.)

> How this came about

Now is a good time for me to tell you a bit more about myself.

> I am bizarrely proficient at base R graphics.

I started using R around the time I took my first statistics
course, which was nine years ago.

> Pro tip: Free software is usually better.

I looked at the various free software for statistics, and R seemed
like the best one. I think it was a good choice.

> I made graphs in base R graphics. (You should use ggplot.)

I kind of knew about ggplot at the time, but I didn't use it for
some reason. In retrospect, I think videos are easier to make in
base R graphics, but ggplot is better for pretty much anything else.

### If you are going to make data music videos, R is a good tool.

1. Vector graphics (for video)
2. Optimized matrix operations (for music)
3. Integrations with many standard data stores

## How to make music videos in R
I hope I have convinced you that data music videos are promising
enough that you'll at least watch me show you how to make them in R.
I'm going to show you how to make video, how to make music, and how
to combine the two.

1. Video
2. Music
3. Combining them

If you want to make data music videos, you also need to get your data
into R. I'm not going to talk about that today.


## Why this matters

### The business case
If you have a particularly complex and difficult dataset, data music
videos might give you a good and fast return on investment.
But the tools for this aren't fully developed and stable, so I can't
recommend it in general.

### Stop limiting yourself to "visualization"
You can still draw some useful inspiration from data music.
I am amused that this talk was included in the "visualization" track.

It's about plotting, converting data from abstract to concrete
metaphors...
we have to find the meaningful representation, and that's about
leveraging our existing intuitions; there's nothing specifically
visual about it.

I think we started out calling this stuff "visualization" because
it's easier to record and read visual things like books rather than
things with other senses, like smell....

# Plotting data as music videos in R

## The promise of music videos
Let's talk about why we plot data. Data are abstract numbers that
become meaningful to us only when we can perceive them.

We typically map the data to visuals, and we call this process
"data visualization".

In order that our visualizations can reveal unexpected patterns,
it is important that we present many dimensions at once.

Also, data are much more complex than they were in the past, so we
increasingly need to represent highly complex datasets. There is only
so much big data that we can fit in a visualization.

We can apply a model to reduce the data to something more manageable,
but when we do this, we lose the opportunity to analyze the raw variables.

I have been trying to use our non-visual senses to increase our sensory
bandwidth.

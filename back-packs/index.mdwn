What backpack to get? I want a small one with lots of big pockets.

* I have the Tom Bihn Synapse 19.
* [Haglöfs Tight XS](http://www.haglofs.com/gb/en/gb/en/Backpacks-and-Bags/TIGHT-XS/p/293001.2LT) has only one pocket but has compression strap, nice for clothes, and comes in pink.
* [Haglöfs Corker Small](http://www.haglofs.com/gb/en/Backpacks-and-Bags/CORKER-SMALL/p/339200.2D4) has one pocket only, I think, and comes in pink.
* [Quechua ARP 10](http://www.quechua.co.uk/arp-10-backpack-pink-id_137476)
* [Bird vest](http://www.badlandspacks.com/birdvest-hunting-pack.html) could
    work well in concert with another backpack.
* [Typohoon](http://www.maxpedition.com/store/pc/TYPHOON-BACKPACK-3p1577.htm)
    has lots of pockets but looks scary.
* You can clip extra pockets to the
    [Condor backpack](http://www.maxpedition.com/store/pc/CONDOR-II-BACKPACK-109p106.htm),
    so I could have my clothes in the extra pockets and drop them off at home, for example.

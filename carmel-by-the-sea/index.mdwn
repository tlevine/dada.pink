# Carmel-by-the-Sea
I had a hunch a few years ago about how municpalities work.

I figured that any particular big city would have a wider variety of
happenings, political views, social circles, &c. than a small town
would. If this is the case, a particular person with particular preferences
would be more able to find things he prefers in a big city, just because
it's more likely that such things are available. I started pondering how
I might identify small towns that appeal to particular preferences.

I was pondering how one could select a small town
to visit or live in 

My intuition is that a small town has less
variety of stuff going on in it than a big city does, and I was wondering
how I would

had the following idea: Big cities probably have
a bigger variety of things happening in them than small towns.

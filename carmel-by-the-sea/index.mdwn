# Carmel-by-the-Sea
I had a hunch a about how municpalities work.

I figured that any particular big city would have a wider variety of
happenings, political views, social circles, &c. than a small town
would. If this is the case, a particular person with particular preferences
would be more able to find things he prefers in a big city, just because
it's more likely that such things are available. I started pondering how
I might identify small towns that appeal to particular preferences.

I had recently attended university in Ithaca, New York, which is a
(pleasantly) strange place. It bothered me that I could only determine
what a place was like after having accidentally moved there; I wanted to
look more systematically for places based on their character.

I never determined whether my hunch was correct, but it contributed to
the idea that I'm about to present.

## Ithaca
I considered what was peculiar about Ithaca. Lots of things came to mind,
but I focused on the things that were easy to articulate/test.

* Seemingly everybody composts.
* It has a three tertiary schools.
* Wacky stuff like yoga is popular.
* People consider their ecological impacts.
* There are lots of farms nearby.
* Public transit is reasonably good, and the downtown is quite walkable.

I search around for data related to the above things and other things
and arrived at the
[teacher directory](https://www.yogaalliance.org/Directory?Type=Teacher)
of the [Yoga Alliance](https://www.yogaalliance.org/).
This directory included contact information for each of 40,000 teachers,
often with full addresses. How interesting.

## A brief aside about Ithaca
A couple years later, I determined that Ithaca is rather typical of
college towns in the United States. The college attracts money and
crazy people to a relatively inexpensive area that would otherwise seem
a bit remote. It winds up being a good place to do art, to express
extreme politics, and to retire.

## Yoga
Back to Carmel and yoga. I obtained all of the
[addresses](https://github.com/tlevine/quinoa-index/tree/master/collect/yoga)
that were available in the teacher directory. The addresses had zip codes,
so I also obtained
[population figures by zip code](https://github.com/tlevine/quinoa-index/tree/master/collect/population)
from the United States census.

Then I divided the number of yoga teachers in each zip code by the number
of people in each zip code, arriving at the number of yoga teachers per
capita. The zip code with the highest rate of yoga teachers was 93921,
which contains the town of Carmel-by-the-Sea. My expectation was that
the town with the highest rate of yoga teachers would be sort of strange,
simply because that's how outliers are. The
[Wikipedia article about Carmel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmel-by-the-Sea,_California)
met my expectation.

In particular, I enjoyed that houses don't have street numbers; they have
names instead.

I also saw that it had a walk score of [94](http://www.walkscore.com/score/93921)),
which is quite high.

Here are two other places that scored pretty high.

* [Aspen, CO, 81612](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspen,_Colorado)
    (walkscore: [0](http://www.walkscore.com/score/81611))
* [Paia, HI, 96779](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paia,_Hawaii)
    ([a "collest small town"](http://www.budgettravel.com/feature/10-coolest-small-towns-hawaii,5098/),
    (walkscore: [6](http://www.walkscore.com/score/96779))

Carmel seemed particularly odd, so I looked into it further. What's the yoga
scene like in Carmel? It turned out that there's was big
[yoga school](http://www.yogacentercarmel.org/) that
[trains teachers](http://www.yogacentercarmel.org/training/Yoga%20Center%20of%20Carmel%20Teacher%20Training.pdf)
and accounted for the majority of the teachers in my dataset.

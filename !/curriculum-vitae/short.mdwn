I do consulting now, but I'm interested in taking a normal job in a quiet area,
as most American cities are too loud for me. I'm open to pretty much location
on the planet and might even consider other planets.

Design & Environmental Analysis (Concentration in Human Factors & Ergonomics)

## Awards
* Hunter R. Rawlings III Cornell Presidential Research Scholar

## Data science consulting
*(May 2011 to present)*

I help organizations take advantage of data. Services include

* Data strategy and architecture
* Data visualization
* Data warehousing, extract-transform-load (ETL), &c.
* Thought leadership on data gastronomification and other visualization-alternatives

I'm usually happy to travel pretty much anywhere, and I'm also quite
good at collaborating remotely.

### Technology
I use a wide range of technologies as appropriate.
I am *quite good* with dynamic programming languages,

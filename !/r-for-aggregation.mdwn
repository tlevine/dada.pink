Someone asked me what she should learn so she could handle datasets
that don't fit in Excel. R? Python? Separations by language are kind
of useless.

In this case, maybe you just need to know how to make the data smaller.
Here are some ways you can do that.

In R::

    # Load a CSV file
    contracts <- read.csv(‘contracts.csv’, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
    
    # Query with SQL
    library(sqldf)
    smaller <- sqldf(‘SELECT sum(Amount) FROM contracts GROUP BY contractor’)

    # Just take the first 100 rows.
    smaller.2 <- contracts[1:100,]

    # Sample
    smaller.3 <- contracts[sample(rownames(contract
    
    # Save
    write.csv(smaller, ‘smaller.csv’, row.names = FALSE)

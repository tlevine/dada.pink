You know how fun it is to watch people be nerdy about
something you completely don't understand? Well maybe you
don't find it fun, but I do. The people who go to spreadsheet
conferences really really really love spreadsheets, and they

and on making music from spreadsheets.
[Eloy](http://ideasexcel.com/) took a

and Rickard
[wrote](http://www.corality.com/training/campus/post/august-2014/eusprig-2014-%E2%80%93-financial-modelling-observations)
about it.

title: Bare domain redirect server
[[!tag toys]]

<!-- created_at: 2012-06-18 -->
In June 2012, I finished switching most of my sites to S3. Compared to what
I had before, this made things so simple and easy; I had a script that mounted
my S3 buckets in ~/s3 with s3fs. When I copied my websites to that directory,
they would get uploaded to S3 with the appropriate headers. Then I could just
set bucket policies and CNAME records and all was well. And then I came up with
the following approach for setting bare domain redirects!

It happens that I've since changed how I do things; now I host most small
things on a server from the [numb server association](http://the-nsa.org/).
I upload things with git or rsync and customize my domain settings with Nginx.
And it might change again by the time you read this! Anyway, let's talk about
the bare domain redirect server that I don't use anymore.

## What I really wanted
I sort of wanted [mod_rewrite as a service](https://twitter.com/thomaslevine/status/214749416635105281),
but I couldn't find that, so I looked for a cheap VPS. I found a bunch of
them through [lowendbox](http://www.lowendbox.com). I settled on the cheapest
plan I could find. Here are the specs.

    KVM1 Budget KVM VPS
    1 Core / 128MB RAM / 6GB HD
    Bandwidth: 256GB
    SAS2 10K RAID storage

I installed Debian and set up a little script that lets me do this.

    ssh rewrite.thomaslevine.com 'add_rewrite thomaslevine.com'

I just need to point the `thomaslevine.com` A record to `rewrite`'s
IP address, run the above command, and host `www.thomaslevine.com`
somewhere else.

Well that's what I had originally, but even that was too annoying,
so I made a little website that did it all. Read more about that
version [here](https://github.com/tlevine/redirect.thomaslevine.com).

## Low-end VPS plans
This VPS is absurdly powerful, so I was pondering doing some other things on
the same box too. But it's so cheap (â‚¬11.25 per year) that it's sort of not
worth trying to use it to its full extend.

I might get a couple of these more for git and piwik, respectively.
Also, if you find yourself needing bare domain redirects, tell me, and I'll
be happy to set them up for you.

I like to [sleep](/!/sleeping/), and I'm usually
curious about why people do anything else.
My favorite color is [pink](/img/me-420.png).

## Ergonomics
I apparently know something about
[ergonomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_factors_and_ergonomics).
I have made assembly lines for fun since as long as I remember,
and I noticed that it was weird only at university while I was
making a snow fort with some other people.
It seems also that I pay unusually much attention to why and how
[people](http://small.dada.pink/dadawarehouse/README)
[do](/!/hovering-cycle/)
[things](/!/reciprocity/).

<!-- (/!/why-do-people-crack-wrists/) -->

My back and wrists started hurting when I was about 13. It might
have had something to do with me playing cello and using computers
a lot. Then I started reading and doing ergonomicsy things related to
how backs and wrists work. And then my back and wrists didn't hurt as
much. And then I went to university and got a degree in ergonomics.

## Computer
When I'm not sleeping, I sometimes makes things that
[do](http://small.dada.pink/whom-to-email/README)
[my](/!/geeky-free-software-project)
[work](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tlevine)
for me so I have 
more time to sleep. My main trick is to articulate an
intuition in math and then repeat stupid things
[many](/!/searching-data-tables-better/)
[many](/open-data)
[times](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pluplusch).
This might be why people started calling me a data scientist.

I usually doesn't like talking about computers, or at least not in the
way that people usually talk about them. It's about as interesting as talking
about how to sharpen a pencil---probably fun once in a while, but boring
if it's all that people ever want to talk about, especially if there isn't
anything interesting to write about with your sharpened pencil.

## Teaching
The sort of teaching that people talk about is a
[lot of work](/!/learning-data-stuff/),
so here is how I like to teach people instead.

Do your own project or whatever, and try to learn the things that you
think you need to learn. If there's something that is taking you a while
to figure out, try to avoid learning it. If you can't avoid learning it,
ask someone (so maybe me) for some help with that thing.

Recall that this thing was hard to learn and also so important that you
couldn't avoid learning it. How unfortunate that something so important
is so hard to learn! How fortunate that you can change that!

If you ask me and I think I can help, I'll meet with you in person or
over the phone or something and try to explain. During our session, we'll
take copious notes on everything we did. If you finally understand the
thing, we (or, preferably, you) might consider making something that
helps other people understand this confusing and important thing.

Preferably, this thing will not involve much work from a teacher.
For example, videos, drawings, and writings are great.
Activities like classes and games are also good if you record them
somehow, like by taking a video, sharing notes, or writing directions
for the activity.
(If I do it, I'll probably
[write](/!/street-sign-protocol)
[something](/!/downloading-binary-files-is-not-magic/).)
Here's an example of
[a time I did this](/!/switching-to-command-line/).

### The person's mental model
The person is expecting me to answer with a goal that sounds reasonable.
The odd feeling that I mention above is the feeling that I need to have a
goal in life. I may feel pressure to frame some stuff that I do as a goal
even if I don't think of myself as having a goal. On the other hand, I may
truly have a goal in life, in which case his expectation was right.

If I say in response that I don't have a goal in life, then I don't fit into
the person's mental model about goals. The person might try to resolve the
contradiction by deciding that one of the following statements is true.

* The person's model of the world is inadequete: Passions are not a
    meaningful way of categorizing people. (The person is least likely
    to resolve the contradiction this way.)
* People can be divided into those with passions and those without passions.
    People in the former group are *better*, and I am in the latter group.
* I really do have a passion, but I am being modest, being a wise-guy,
    under-selling myself, &c.

### Wanting to believe
If the person finds a way of preserving his mental model, the person is
showing that he really wants to believe in this model of the world.
Why might he want that? I can usually explain it as one of the following.

1. He or she has recently come up with a passion and is hoping that his
    strategy of coming up with a passion was a good idea.
2. He or she wants to fit in with a group of people who talk about their
    passions.

It is hard to know whether your mental model is right. (In this case, it's
hard to know whether having a passion is a good idea.) Also, it is scary
to be following a mental model that you don't know is right. Thus, people
sometimes try really hard to convince themselves that their mental models
are right.

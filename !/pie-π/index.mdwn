title: Pie π

I made a pie π! No, not a [pypy](http://pypy.org),

![PyPy logo](pypy.png)

nor a [π pie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pi_pie2.jpg),

and not even π pies.

I mean a letter π made of pied type!

![A letter "π" made of jumbled up letters, printed in green ink on off-white paper](pie-π.jpg).

I printed this on letterpress on March 14, 2009.
(That was back when I used π; now I use [τ](http://tauday.com/).)

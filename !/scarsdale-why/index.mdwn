I apparently

[data](/!/hip-data-nonsense/),
and I've recently been

[around](http://www.american.edu/americantoday/campus-news/20120420-SOC-Partners-with-Washington-Post-for-ScraperWiki-Event.cfm)
[journalists](http://allthingsd.com/20120623/scraperwiki-tries-to-turn-journalists-into-hackers/),
so I figured I could do some data journalism, perhaps with more of an emphasis
on the "data" than the "journalism".

I grew up in and still live in [Scarsdale](http://www.scarsdale.com), a town
and village of about 17,000 people. Unsurprisingly, there isn't even much
conventional journalism here.

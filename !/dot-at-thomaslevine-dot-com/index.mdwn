Since I can have any address at thomaslevine.com,
I've had a hard time choosing one. There's a fun,
long story about previous email addresses, and I
can explain that some other time. Anyway, I've
changed my email address yet again, and now it's
[.@thomaslevine.com](mailto:.@thomaslevine.com).

*Actually, it has
[changed since]();
it turns out that that address wasn't valid.
I haven't updated the rest of the present article,
however, so it still incorrectly suggests that this
address is valid.*

## Validity
Most websites are fine with this new email address,
but some don't like it.

It works in [Mailman](http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/).

When I try to change my email address in
[Facebook](https://facebook.com/perluette),
it says I "must provide a valid email."

<img src="facebook.png" alt=""You must provide a valid email." error message" class="wide" />

It works on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thomaslevine).

<img src="twitter.png" alt=""A confirmation email was sent" success message" class="wide" />

[Pinterest](https://pinterest.com/perluette) says it's "not a valid email format".

[Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com) says it "isn't correct".

!["The email address isn't correct." error message](tumblr.png)

[PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi) and 
[npm](http://npmjs.org/) let's me update my email address just fine.

But the [Arch User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org) doesn't.

[data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk) allows my address.

I couldn't test [data.gov](https://data.gov).

It's not just websites that are getting it wrong; some mail servers don't
recognize it!

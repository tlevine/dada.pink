title: Data Wranglers DC PDF parsing
[[!tag learn]]
[[!tag convert]]

I'm talking about PDFs
[at Data Wranglers DC](http://www.meetup.com/Data-Wranglers-DC/events/160592492/).

## Abstract
Much of the world’s data are stored in portable document format (PDF) files. This is not my preferred storage or presentation format, so I often convert such files
into databases, graphs, or spreadsheets. When I'm reading PDF files, I ask these questions.

* Do we need to read the file contents at all?
* Do we only need to extract the text and/or images?
* Do we care about the layout of the file?

I take different approaches to parsing depending on the answers to these questions.
In the talk, I’ll show a few different approaches to parsing and analyzing PDF
files, and I'll discuss which approaches make sense in which situations.

## Materials
We'll use this as a permanent URL for the materials for the talk.
I'm dumping everything in the following git repository.

    git clone git@github.com:tlevine/data-wranglers-dc-pdfs

You can also view the files in a web browser
[here](https://github.com/tlevine/data-wranglers-dc-pdfs).

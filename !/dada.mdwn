title: Why dada

I've never particularly liked explaining what I "do", and I
think I kind of reject the concept of such categorization.
I wrote an article for a very uninteresting and businessy
publication, and the editor asked for my job title.

> 1. We have put a "Job Title" / description beneath each author's name.
> What should I put for yours? "!" ;-) "Data Researcher" "Data Tinkerer"
> "Data Artist"

None of these felt quite right.

What about da<strong>d</strong>a? [David Riordan](http://magicschoolb.us/)
had invented big dada at the Students for Free Culture
conference a few months prior and convinced me to give a
lightning talk about the relationship between free culture
and the data thing. This was too reasonable to be considered
dada, but the name stuck in my mind.

I read multiple
[dada](https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Manifeste_DaDa)
[manifestos](http://www.ralphmag.org/AR/dada.html)
and thought that Dada was a rather perfect description
for what I do. Also, I enjoyed the ease of confusing dada for data.
So I told her "Dada Artist".

I don't
know whether they wound up using it in this publication, but I've been using it
ever since.

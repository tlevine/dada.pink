[[!meta title="Calling Tom"]]

If you're in the United States, you probably want to call
[+1 229 516 1541](tel:12295161541).

If you're in another country or the above number is otherwise a long
distance number, you can call [+883 51000 9902082](tel:883510009902082),
which should be a local call. This can sometimes be treated erroneously
as a long-distance call, so read [here](inum) for some tricks related to
calling this number.

description: CSV is the people's data format, the common language that will unite us and bring world peace.

Some friends and I started making music based on "data" (dunno exactly
what I mean by that), and then it spiraled out of control. Also,
I recognized that everybody in this computer bubble is pretending
to know what she's doing and that she thus won't call you out when
you're lying. That led to hilarious incidents like this.

The part about how we're a consulting firm with lots of employees
and big clients is all made up, but you might be surprised by how
much is true; here are the
[slides](http://small.dada.pink/gastronomification-big-data-talk/eusprig-2014/sheetmusic.pdf)
from a similar talk that I gave at the 2014 meeting of the
[European Spreadsheet Risk Interest Group](http://eusprig.org)
and the stuff in there is all true.

As of this writing, the most recent development in the area of
data gastronomification is that
[döner plot](/!/geom_doner/) from after the
[August meeting](http://www.meetup.com/Hacks-Hackers-Berlin/events/199099472/)
of [Hacks/Hackers Berlin](https://www.meetup.com/Hacks-Hackers-Berlin/).

Aside from performing
[data music](http://fms.csvsoundsystem.com/),
[aforementioned friends](http://csvsoundsystem.com)
and I are very into commas.

You see,
[csv is the platonic form of data](https://twitter.com/nypl_labs/status/420298290283184128).
I occasionally
[get very emotional](http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130429/greenpoint/data-driven-band-csv-soundsystem-makes-music-from-spreadsheets)
about CSV files.

We also want to open a cooperative data store with locally sourced
data tables and [artisinal data analysis](/!/print-formaldehyde/).
We'll spread sheets over these tables, which we'll stock from
a data warehouse, and we'll use random number books to run
artisinal simulations.

title: Job interview
description: Things I wonder about jobs
-----------------------------------------------------------

Here are some questions that I find myself asking in the early stages
of job interviews. If you are interested in hiring me, please answer these
questions (or at least some of them) before we talk.

1. What's the job? (You don't have to tell me the company.)
2. What's the pay?
3. What's the process like for applying and interviewing?
    In particular, how much work will it be on my end?
4. Is part-time or consulting possible?
5. How much funding does the company have?
6. Is the company making a profit?

And here are some things that people almost always want to know.

* Here is a [resume](/!/curriculum-vitae/short/)
* You can read more about me at [thomaslevine.com](/).
* I'll relocate or travel for the right job.
* I am a citizen of the United States.

Since I have been doing freelance consulting for my whole career,
the following points usually come up.

* I would become a full-time employee if it paid well; I'm mainly doing
    consulting because I haven't found a normal job that would pay as well.
* I might be able to start right away, or I might need a couple months
    before I can start. In the latter case, I might be able to start
    part-time soon and switch to full-time later.

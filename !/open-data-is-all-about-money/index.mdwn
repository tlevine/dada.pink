Open data is all about money, and despite all the wishful thinking of
[transparency](http://opengovernmentdata.org/) and
[accountability](http://sunlightfoundation.com/issues/)
that you might hear from open data hippie weirdos.

Go to [data.gov](https://www.data.gov), and click on
"[IMPACT](https://www.data.gov/impact/)". (In case it changes,
I [printed](impact.pdf) it.) <!-- also [HTML](impact.html) -->
You'll learn that

> Open data is fuel for innovators. It has the potential to generate more than $3 trillion a year in additional value in sectors including finance, consumer products, health, energy and education, according to a recent study.

You'll see "a few examples of companies leveraging open data".

And you'll see nothing about transparency and accountability.

Okay, maybe other governments are different, but at least in the
United States, anything other than big money is crazy talk.

I've been helping [Addicaid](http://addicaid.com/) think about data.

Here's part of an analysis I did for them a while ago. I collected
information about addiction recovery meetings within 125 miles of Brooklyn
from [In The Rooms](http://www.intherooms.com).

Let's focus on New York city because most of them are there.

Most meetings list the day and time at which they meet, so we can also see when
they happen during the week. Getting this to render nicely in a web browser was
annoying, so you get it as a [pdf](over-week.pdf).

It also turns out that some of the coordinates
are totally wrong, like those of the most-listed location,
[993 Intervale Avenue](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=993+intervale+avenue+10457&hl=en&ll=40.823013,-73.896908&spn=0.00352,0.006968&hnear=993+Intervale+Ave,+Bronx,+New+York+10459&gl=us&t=h&z=18).
But I suspect that these plots over time are still informative.

The data are unpleasant in other ways; in particular, I sometimes treated meetings
after noon as having happened twelve hours earlier. This explains the 1 am
meetings. Aside from these errors, meetings tend to happen when people are
neither working nor sleeping.

Anyway, some particularly popular locations stand out. But I think these are easier to see
in table form; here are the locations that had at least ten meetings.
(Some of these locations are actually the same place with different links.)

This begins to show us who runs addiction recovery meetings, what places host them, &c.

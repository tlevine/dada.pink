[[!tag shenanigans letterpress]]

I did a lot of letterpress printing in college.

After having made some letterpress prints for various events and initiatives,
I determined that few mortal endeavours were worthy of my wonderful posters,
so I decided to cool posters, even if I didn't have anything to print them about.

I had also become quite interested in the power of public notices. Although
anyone can put up a sign, and people take signs pretty seriously.

My dorm had a history of nude jello wrestling, but I don't think it ever
happened while I was at school. In my freshman year, it was sort of legendary
for nude jello wrestling and other scandals, but the legend seemed gone by
my senior year. I didn't really want to wrestle, let alone wrestling nude
in jello, but I did want to continue this jello wrestling legend.

In December 2010, I printed a few dozen of these posters.

Few people knew that I had printed these, and there were never any plans for
nude jello wrestling to happen.

During the week before February 18, I stealthily posted about six of these
posters around campus. Most of them got taken down about a day after I had
posted them, which is bizarrely fast. I suspected that it was because people
hated them and considered them inappropriated or because people loved them
and wanted to keep them for themselves.

During that week, a couple of friends independently guessed that I had posted
them. I suspect that many more people saw them.

It happened that February 18 was the day before the
[Students for Free Culture conference](http://conf11.freeculture.org/),
so I missed the non-event, but I heard that several people had at least considered going.
I didn't hear of anyone actually showing up, and I suspect that the weather had something
to do with that.

I wanted to know more about people react to these posters. On the same night in December
2010 when I had printed the February 18 posters, I had also printed some of these.

Like before, I posted a few of these around campus on the week before the
non-event. This time, I wrote my Cornell email address at the bottom of the posters
in hopes that people would ask me for more information. But I really wanted to see
why they were coming down.

The posters came down even faster this time than they had before! Nobody emailed me,
but it seems like people really liked the posters; one friend mentioned that she had
considered taking one down and keeping it but that she left it up so that others
would see it.

I actually forgot about the non-event and got there about half an hour late. That
is, I walked downstairs to my dorm lobby and looked around. I saw one male sitting
on a bench, but I didn't ask why he was there. Anticlimatic.

But I learned a few days later of a wonderful phone call that one of my dormmates
received that night. She had known that this wasn't happening. One of her friends had
apparently snuck into the dorm and then called her. The call went something like this.

> A: Yo, where's the nude jello wrestling?
> 
> B: There is no nude jello wrestling; you got trolled.
> 
> A: No, it's real, we saw posters!

Success.

I wear a burqua to drag parties.

This is hilarious for a few relatively superficial reasons.

* Nobody else does it.
* It's a lot more convincing than other drag.
* Even though it conceals me, it is totally obvious that I'm under it as
    nobody else would ever do it.

But its real hilarity comes from a deeper troll.

The garment offends the hippie liberal Americans who say that it is a symbol of repression
of women by extreme forms of Islam and that it is not funny. This stereotypical American
doesn't realize how awesome burquas are, portrays extreme Muslims as immoral pigs, and overestimates
how many Muslims of this sort exist.

Conversely, my attendance of such a scandalous drag party might offend those
extreme Muslims that those hippie liberal Americans oppose. (A side note:
Since I only ever wore my burqua at university in upstate New York, it's more
important that the American university students would expect people to
take offense than it is that people would actually take offense.
I've discussed my wearing of this garment with only very few
people who would be able to tell me how different cultures would react to
this, and I have no idea how different cultures would react.)

It's funny enough that I'd manage to offend these two opposing groups.
It gets even more hilarious when you consider that
I am the most modestly dressed of anyone at the party;
with everyone else dressed as stereotypical sluts or pimps,
I'm the last person with whom you should take offense.

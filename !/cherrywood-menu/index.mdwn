The smoothies section of this menu from
[Cherrywood Coffeehouse](http://cherrywoodcoffeehouse.com/) is designed for
both beginners and intermediates; beginners immediately see the five smoothie
choices at the top and intermediates know to look at the bottom to "design
[their] own". Experts can order things that aren’t on the menu.

<img alt="Menu says &quot;Smoothies&quot;, lists five types of smoothies, then has a &quot;Design your own&quot; section."

intermediates and experts, read

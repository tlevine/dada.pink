You know how it's really fun to be around people who are really
nerdy about some thing that you totally don't understand? That's
what EuSpRIG was like; everyone there **loves** spreadsheets.
A bunch (most?) teach spreadsheet development in some capacity,
a bunch develop or audit rather complex spreadsheets regularly
for their work. (These bunches overlap, of course.) And the
people who don't fall into either of the above bunches research
how people use spreadsheets. In the bar after the conference,
I learned about everyone's favorite spreadsheet shortcuts.
Also, Delft is pretty. :)


Relearn

* Bits and sound: Notes on combining arbitrary image and sound
* I mostly wrote sheetmusic as a joke, but now people want
    to use it !? People at Relearn imported their ASCII PNM
    image files as space-delimited values and then wrote
    spreadsheets to convert the images into music.
* Plotter plots and polar coordinates

## Covariance
Covariance is the average of these rectangles.

## Variance
Variance is just the covariance of something with itself.

## Correlation
We can form a rectangle with the sides of the variance squares. We can draw
two overlapping rectangles on top of that based on the covariance, and their
intersection forms another rectangle.

It happens that the absolute area of the covariance rectangle is less than or
equal to the area of this rectangle. The following doodle might convince you
of that.

Correlation is how much of the aforedoodled rectangle is filled by the
covariance; $$R$$ is the proportion along a side, and $$R^2$$ is the proportion
of the area. The dimensions of that rectangle and of three rectangles that it
encloses are drawn below.

## Ordinary least squares regression
Each OLS regression coefficient is like the quotient of the
rectangles in the top of this doodle and the squares in the bottom.

I'll be shocked if anyone followed these scribbles; I'll make a video eventually.

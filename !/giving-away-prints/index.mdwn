I have a bunch of fun printed things sitting at my parents'
house and not getting seen. This seems silly. Does anyone
want any? Here are some of the available things.

Designer pizza boxes

* [Paul Rand Pizza Box](/!/paul-rand-pizza-box)
* [Modernist Pizza Box](/!/modernist-pizza-box)
* I also have about 40 blank pizza boxes left.

Trolling

* [Nude Jello Wrestling posters](/!/jello-wrestling)
* Notice regarding the ficticious demolition of a very real parking lot
* Artifacts of Tal and my exhibit on
    [Desk Height and Other Ergonomic Delights](http://smug.thomaslevine.com/organize/Installations/Desks-and-Other-Ergonomic)

Just pretty

* [Poster](/!/fcc-20)
    for a Free Culture Cornell meeting featuring a
    Richard Stallman quote.
* [Mind your p's and q's](/!/pbdq/)
* Deceptively cute shirts about [bunnies](/!/bunnies)
    (Although they're shirts, I recommend against wearing
    them because they're not that comfortable.)

I also have some letterpress doodles that are mostly interesting
because of the specifics of how they were printed.

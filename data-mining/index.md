# Predicting the future: What the data mining industry can learn from the literal mining industry

## The theory
I have worked in data science for a few years and was thus quite familiar
with terms like "big data",

> Big data

"web scraping",

> Web scraping

and "data mining".

> Data mining

Over the past year, I had the opportunity to learn a lot about mining and
to visit a real mine. When I say "mining", I really mean mining. Coal mining.

> *Coal*  mining

Having seen how literal mines work, I now understand metaphorical data
mining systems much better.

> Metaphors

More importantly, however, I was able to see the future of the field of
data mining.

> The future of data science

Data science is still in its infancy. New data science technology is
still being developed every day, and the future of data science may
seem totally unpredictable. But we can predict the future of data science,

> The past of literal mining

by looking at the history of literal mining.

The mining industry as a whole is very similar to the data mining industry

## About me

I say something here to convince you that I'm an authority on data science.

# Predicting the future: What the data mining industry can learn from the literal mining industry

## The theory
I have worked in data science for a few years and was thus quite familiar
with terms like "big data",

> Big data

"web scraping",

> Web scraping

and "data mining".

> Data mining

Over the past year, I had the opportunity to learn a lot about mining and
to visit a real mine. When I say "mining", I really mean mining. Coal mining.

> *Coal*  mining

Having seen how literal mines work, I now understand metaphorical data
mining systems much better.

> Metaphors

More importantly, however, I was able to see the future of the field of
data mining.

> The future of data science

The data mining industry has a lot to learn from the literal mining
industry. Earth miners are just like data miners, except it's a few
centuries ahead of us. In this article I discuss

1. History of mining
2. Data v. earth
3. Future of data mining
4. Learning from earth mining

the history of mining and the fundamental parallels between data mining
and earth mining. By looking at the history of mining, I have also seen
the future of data-mining. I'll end with some practical tips as to how
an understanding of mining history can help you prepare your organization
for the future of data mining.

## About me

I say something here to convince you that I'm an authority on data science.

## History of mining



## Present state of data science
Data mining today is where mining was in the XXXXs.

Blah blah.


We have this, and we don't have that.

Things are like this.

People talk about this.

## The future
In the future, we will see

> more

> bigger

> activism

> extension (tours of data mines, data science museums)

## Preparing for the future

> Formal training

We're already seeing this with bootcamps, but we need real degree
programs...

> Better security

Don't just wing it startup-style

> Complex business models

Tagebau Hambach is profitible only because of it combines its primary
income as a power utility with several alternative business models.

* Government subsidies
* Logging
* Recreation

> Community outreach

People don't understand...
value of data
People are scared of things they don't understand.

> Prepare for activists

Even with our best outreach efforts, we won't be able to stop all of
the activists. Someone is going to be angry at you just for being big,
and the activists will only get more and more disruptive.

> (video or picture)

Activists will not stop us if we are vigilent. As activism becomes more
developed, we need to recognize that it is happening.

> Budget for sabotage

Like RWE, your organization should budget for losses of productivity from
destruction of property by activists. You should also develop an anti-activism
division, to interfere with the activism. Activism is simply another expense
that we need to be ready for.

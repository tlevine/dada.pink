secret: True

This is really about a lot more than money....



Here I put forth my theory about the two sorts of motives that there
are for making money, and then I use this theory to explain how some
strange things work in the world.

## Two motives for making money
I group motives for making money into two groups.

1. Sustaining oneself
2. Playing a game

On one hand, we use money to transact goods that we need for our
survival. On the other hand, money functions as a score in the game
of life and as a means to partaking in other aspects of the game.

While you might personally care more about one of the motives,
both motives are real and legitimate.

## Sustinance motive
Most people are nearly broke and are thus in survival mode when it comes
to money. They pay attention to how much money they spend because really
bad things would happen if they spent too much.

## Gaming motive
As people make more money, people usually develop more expensive lifestyles.
To some degree, they remain in the survival mode because they need to sustain
a more expensive lifestyle.

But they also develop savings and confidence of their employability, and this
allows them to worry less about basic survival. As the concern for basic
survival diminishes, money becomes more of a game.

Making lots of money is like scoring points in a game, and once you have the
money, you can spend it on other types of points/trophies and on playing
bigger games.

...

## Clashes between motives




## Ethical considerations
I believe that both of these motives are absolutely legitimate, but I also
recognize that clashes between them can be unpleasant.

People in the game-playing mode have power.... I recommend that they design
their game-playing in such a way that they can have fun with minimal collateral
damage to everyone else.


Examples of problems

Geopolitics

* Yugoslavia fell apart because of silly geopolitics.
    Colleagues on other sides...
    It is acceptable to
    engage in war for silly reasons, but you should try not to get people
    too riled up
* Techno parties
* Stock market

On rules of war

* All those wars where America went in and couldn't get out
    America goes in to play a game, but their opponents are fighting for
    survival.
* We have rules for war because we recognize that war is a game for at least
    the people who are leading the warriors.
* When people are fighting for survival rather than for the game, they
    do not care about following these rules.


Theft for fun versus theft for the thrill

* Petty theft
* Hidden fees, &c.

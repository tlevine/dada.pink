While on my way to the [NICAR](http://www.ire.org/nicar/) 2012
conference, I found myself in Chicago for a couple hours waiting for
a train. This was enough time for me to lunch with a friend who was
working at the University of Chicago.

I was about to catch a bus towards the university when I realized
that my smallest denomination of currency was a $5 bill. Since the buses
only take exact change, I looked around for a way to break it. I asked a
person who was waiting for the bus with me if she could break it, and she
said she didn't have change.

We both wound up getting on the same bus, and I got on first.
I told the bus driver that the $5 was for both of us, and then I promptly
walked to the back of the bus, still a few yards ahead of the other person.

Shortly after I sat down, this person made her way to the back of the bus,
gave me two dollars and then found an empty seat towards the middle of the bus.

This person went slightly out of her way to pay me for the bus ride that
I gave her. Reciprocity is cool.

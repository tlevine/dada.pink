title: Hyperconversation
-----------------------------------------------------------

I put everything I can on the internet so that I don't have to remember
where it is; search engines do that for me. This has hilarious and wonderful
side effects on my conversations.

## Easy sending of emails
Check out this email.

    Subject: Re: [NICAR-L] PDF scrapers
    http://thomaslevine.com/!/parsing-pdfs/

Here's another.

    Subject: Organizing
    Kind of related
    http://thomaslevine.com/!/making-your-personal-website/

One more.

    Subject: English
    http://thomaslevine.com/!/english/ 

The bodies of these emails are just links. Sending URLs rather than the content that
is at the URLs is actually far easier than sending the content; I don't have
to worry about whether I copied things properly, the files I send don't have to
be as large, I don't have to tell people that they're allowed to share the
stuff I send them, and I can send the emails from my phone.

If I couldn't send URLs, I would probably wind up developing something like a URL
for indexing my content privately, and then I'd use that to select the content.

A lot of my emails are like the email above. This happens because writing
the same email twice seems like a waste of time.
When I answer the same question multiple times, I start writing down the
answer so that I don't have to answer it again.
And then I can answer new questions instead!

## On privacy
When my writings are already easy to find on the internet, I don't have to
worry about whether they contain private information; when something I wrote
is on the public internet, I *know* that it is public, because I wouldn't
have made it public if I had the slightest concern that it might contain
private information.

This is part of why it's so easy to share the information.

## Complex responses
If I have already written down the answer to a question and the answer is
on a public website that is easy to find, I can respond very easily and
quickly. But sometimes the answer is spread across multiple things that I
have written, and this is where my hyperconsciousness really shines.
I was able to compose the following response in a couple minutes.

    From: Thomas Levine
    Subject: Re: [NICAR-L] Tracking text-ish documents and the
      changes to documents over time

    I think that lots of people write the same script that you describe;
    here's my version.
    http://thomaslevine.com/!/wsync/

    Nowadays, I save the parsed HTTP response rather than just the body
    of the response.
    http://thomaslevine.com/!/web-sites-to-data-tables-in-depth/

    Either way, they get saved as files. These files will be quite similar,
    so you can save space with backup software that saves incremental changes
    in the files.

While seeming short and simple, this response is in fact long and complex.
The length and complexity are deferred to web pages, making it easier for
me to write and less scary for others to read.

## In-person conversations
Also, my conversations get much more interesting when people read the
repetitive parts first. For example, here's an email that I sent someone
while sitting next to her and talking about teaching data stuff.

    Subject: Data data

    Data and learning and cetera
    http://thomaslevine.com/!/why-i-like-hackerspaces/
    http://thomaslevine.com/datakind/
    http://thomaslevine.com/!/making-your-personal-website/
    http://thomaslevine.com/!/learning-data-stuff/
    http://thomaslevine.com/!/bits/
    
    There's some stuff I missed, so you might find the search box helpful.
    http://thomaslevine.com/ikiwiki.cgi?P=algorithm
    
    And I'm gonna go tag a bunch of these things with "learn" right now.
    http://thomaslevine.com/learn/
    
    Other things

    http://small.dada.pink/whom-to-email/README
    http://small.dada.pink/dadawarehouse/README
    http://thomaslevine.com/!/sleeping/

I didn't have to remember all of that stuff I had written, so I only
had to talk about the parts that I hadn't written about and to listen
to the things that the other person had to say. Much more interesting,
and much less work!

## People already know me when they meet me
I noticed recently that people act like they have known me since forever
only shortly after meeting me. At first, I figured that this must be a
trick or that they must just act this way with everyone. But then I realized
that they really *did* know me because they had read all about me on the
internet!

People do all of the work of getting to know me on the internet, so meeting
them becomes a lot less work for me; I get to learn about them, and I don't
have to tell them about me.

## On immortality
Several people have recently expressed told me that they're excited for
the future when computers advance to the point that we can digitize our
consciousness. You might be surprised to learn that this future is already
here. Moreover, it has already been here for a while.

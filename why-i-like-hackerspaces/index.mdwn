[[!tag learn]]

I see the following attitude a lot, especially in San Francisco.

> We know how this complex fancy thing works, but a lot of other people don't, and it's hard to explain the thing.
> Let's make tools so other people can do the thing without needing to understand how it works.

For example, running R and Hadoop is hard, so we're going to make a phone
app that lets normal people do it. And making websites is hard, so we'll
make a web application in which one can make websites by pointing and clicking.

This stuff is hard, so we're going to make it easy, and then more people are going to be able to do it. Great!

## Really?
Look at what happens when I bold some of the words.

> **We** know how this complex fancy thing works, but a lot of other people don't, and it's hard to explain the thing.
> Let's make so **other people** can do the thing without needing to understand how it works.

We are special people who know how to do complex fancy things, and we need to
simplify the things that we do so that normal people can do them too.

## Specialness
It's great to have tools that make annoying things less annoying,
but this attitude goes much further than that. You can see it in how people talk.

People sometimes talk like they know a lot about a thing even though they really don't,
and people other times say that they fundamentally don't have the ability to do some thing.

You might not know much about something right now, and you might not be in the mood to learn it,
but it's really hard to say that you are innately inclined to something or unable to do something else.
The idea of one special person saving the world from a trendy inconvenience makes for a nice
narrative, but I'm skeptical that such persons are all that special.

Also, I don't like being in a special group; can we all just be people?

## Fancy things aren't magic
It's not worth learning all of the things; that would take a while.
On the other hand, you don't need permission to learn the things.
And you're allowed to learn the things in weird ways, like by taking
them apart and seeing what breaks.

People seem to think I'm good at computer stuff. I suppose I am,
but the deeper thing is that I don't see fancy things as magical and
I feel like I'm allowed to understand how they work.
This gets to deeper values like democracy and fairness and representation
and consideration of different perspectives. Treat others as equal,
and encourage them to be just as equal as you are.

## Hackerspaces
In hackerspaces, people aren't trying to be the smart people who are going to
save the masses; they just want to hang out and be people.

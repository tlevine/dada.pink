I generally don't trust that anything that I buy will work as it is
advertised. And even if it does work as advertised, there's a good
chance that it won't work as I want. I think this is why I prefer to
buy cheap things.

Other people must be the same way, so this can explain why salaries
are so low in general; productivity is so unpredictable that employers
don't expect increased salaries to yield better work.

Maybe I would like to make only a little money doing only a little bit
of work. For whatever reason, people seem to want full-time employees
rather than part-time employees. It's better for consultants, but they
are still expected to work hard or to have lots of credibility.

Maybe I would enjoy selling very cheap products.

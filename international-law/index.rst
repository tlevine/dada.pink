I get an impression that the whole mess has something to do with
continued rule by outsiders. And I heard a stronger version of this
from someone from Serbia (I think), whom I met in Bosnia two years
ago. Well, yeah, duh, I should have known.

The more interesting part is that I keep seeing references in these
articles to "war crimes", "crimes against humanity". Here are some
related international laws.

Does these laws/entities call themselves "International" because
they need to convince themselves that they're international when
they're really just Western Europe and the United States?

It's seems a bit bizarre to me that these people would establish a
court with offices in Europe and consider itself to have some
authority in the affairs of other countries. It's also strange that 
the people who are indicted, or at least the ones that we hear about,
tend to be on the losing side of the war and to be from anywhere
other than the West.

It's like the West has invented a game called "war" that enterprising
young countries can play. You may take part in war as long as you are
civilized and you follow the rules.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court#Subject-matter_jurisdiction

But we all know that the West is very civilized, so they don't have to
follow the rules. Or, the West made the rules and interprets the rules,
so the rules don't address the various bad things that the West does,
like

* apartheid, persecution, or genocide under a different name
  (often disguised as capitalism or law enforcement)
* complex forms of enslavement
  ("debt" rather than "slavery")
* waging war without declaring it
  (perhaps because we need to save a country from its ruler)
* doing bad things unintentionally
  (because they were just a private company doing business)

And the West is so civilized that it would only ever do something
bad if it had a really good reason, so we shouldn't worry about it
when that happens; we already know they're civilized.

Oh, my reaction is already a thing.

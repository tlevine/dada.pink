On March 26, 2015, I rode my bicycle from Schipol airport to Amsterdam
city center. It was quite amusing.

My bicycle got somewhat damaged on its way to Schipol. It seems that
my front racks are messed up, my front wheel is out of true, and the
thing that the right pedal attaches to is bent such that I can't screw
the pedal back in. I didn't check whether the frame was bent.

Here starts the amusement. I estimate

learned helplessness

bureaucracies don't care about you

I get the impression that bureaucracies are pretty bad everywhere and
that they're especially bad in the area where I grew up. I grew up in
[Scarsdale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarsdale,_New_York), which is
near [New York City](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City).

Under this reasoning, 

For example, 
the only difficulty I have ever had going through immigration or customs
ever was at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York City. Perhaps we should
add that the only other time I saw anyone else have trouble was on Amtrak
entering the United States through Niagara Falls (also in the state of
New York), where everyone on the
car who didn't have United States citizenship (and that happened to be
almost everyone) had trouble.

It seems that something shifted around seventh and eighth grades
(12 to 14 years old).

I remember concluding in seventh grade that school administrators
weren't really going to do anything about how other students were taking
my things and hitting me. Administrators can't do very much about it,
(Or, it would be a lot of work to do something about it, and they may
risk losing their jobs.) and they said they would do stuff about it
because that's what they're supposed to say.

This conclusion was quite a relief as it led quickly to the following corollary.
I can't really do anything alone

I often say that
elementary school was worst, middle school less bad, high school even
less, college even less, not-school even less. These were sudden shifts
at each new school rather than gradual changes each year.

Given what I'm thinking about at the moment, let's consider that

It turns out that I
[could report this to the airline](http://www.norwegian.com/en/customer-services/travel-information/baggage-/baggage-handling/), but I didn't.
(The person at the baggage claim told me I couldn't, but I should have
figured out a way anyway.)

On March 26, 2015, I rode my bicycle from Schipol airport to Amsterdam
city center. It was quite amusing.

## Amusement
My bicycle got somewhat damaged on its way to Schipol. It seems that
my front rack is messed up on the right side (and maybe on the left,
but I'm not sure), my front wheel is out of true, and the
thing that the right pedal attaches to is bent such that I can't screw
the pedal back in. I didn't check whether the frame was bent.
It looks like something pressed really hard from the right side against
the bottom-front of the bicycle.

Here starts the amusement. I checked my bike without substantially
disassembling it and packing it nicely in a box. I had read that such
boxes might not be that effective, so one didn't seem worth it, given
the inconvenience. I estimate that the cost of repairs will be less
that that of a box and about as inconvenient, so not getting a box was
*still* a decent idea. Unless the frame is bent. That could be bad.

The damage didn't seem that bad at first, and that the ride to town
wasn't that long, so I rode it anyway. I put the right pedal on, even though
it didn't go in all the way and was crooked, and I attached the
front-right pannier bag with a bungee cable. I tried not to push very
hard on the right side pedal.

The pedal came off pretty quickly. I tried putting it back in a couple
of times and then eventually just rode without it. I stayed in my
highest gear the whole way so I didn't have to pedal as much.
As usual, my main concern in all of this was that I was breaking some
rule and would get fined for it, but I also knew that I probably was
following the rules and that I probably wouldn't get fined even if I
did break a rule.

One of the times the pedal came off, I hurt my left thumb. I think I
hyperextended the joint at the base of the first metacarpal, and this
made it painful to do much with that hand. That wasn't much of a loss,
as I already didn't want to change gears and I was going slowly enough
not to need the break. Also, my hands got a little bit cold eventually,
and this probably helped reduce swelling.

The most hilarious part is that the ride was still among the easier and
more pleasant of cycle rides I have taken. I preferred my messed-up
bicycle on Dutch roads over my previously-well-tuned bicycle on American roads.

## On the convenience of a bicycle
Although many people had given rave reviews of cycling, I had refrained
until this past December from acquiring one. Bicycles seemed really big,
and I didn't want to have to carry one.
But then I realized in December that
I could ride a bicycle instead of carrying it, and then it seemed rather
convenient, as I find booking and boarding public transit to be rather
stressful and inconvenient. (I'm fine with the trips themselves.)

The appeal of a bicycle is that I can move between cities without using
public transit. Well, this is actually just the beginning; the bicycle
also makes it easier to go to places that aren't served well by public
transit.

Separate from my bicycle acquisition, I had made appointments in Amsterdam,
Netherlands at the end of March and in Stockholm, Sweden at the end of May,
so I had planned on riding between them. But there's water in-between North
America and Europe, so I had to carry it across the ocean somehow. I couldn't
figure out the bicycle policies for cruise ships, and flying on an airplane was
so much cheaper, so that's what I took.

Having the bicycle has been somewhat inconvenient since December, and
it has been too cold for me to want to ride it very far. (More precisely,
I'm fine with the cycling, but I didn't want to camp in cold weather.)
I was still somewhat on-the-fence about whether it was worth it, but I
figured that it would get more convenient in the warmer weather.

How amazing that a bicycle still manages to inconvenience me in the
Netherlands, where cycling should be super convenient!

## Why am I so concerned about this?
I think I'm bothered that I didn't report this to the airline even though
[I can](http://www.norwegian.com/en/customer-services/travel-information/baggage-/baggage-handling/) and might get some money for the damage.
Why didn't I report it?

The person at the baggage claim told me I couldn't, but this isn't a reason
in itself. When he told me this, I knew that a thrifty and reasonable person
should keep asking different people until someone told me yes, as nobody in
a big organization knows the rules.

I figured that the airline probably wouldn't give me anything and that this
would be just as pointless as any other interaction with big organizations.
Moreover, big organizations scare me, and I expect to need to play games to
get anything from of them, even when it's just the service that I paid for.

## Frustration with organizations (of people)
I got the bicycle so I wouldn't need to deal with airlines; how funny it
would be if it made me deal more with the airlines! A bigger thing I am
noticing is that I am absolutely terrified of big organizations.

You can get some idea of the terror by considering how completely ridiculous
it is that
I find riding a bicycle to be more convenient than taking an airplane.

Consider, also, my recent frustration with dividing labor.
I have lately been finding it so much easier to spend a month learning to do
something my self than to hire someone to do it for me
(even if it costs very little money). To get someone else to do something,
I have to find the person, vet her, schedule everything, explain what I want
to happen, check that the thing was done well. And there's even more to do
if the thing wasn't done well.

## How reasonable is this frustration?
I suspect that my aversion to organizations made sense in some other context.

I get the impression that bureaucracies are pretty bad everywhere and
that they're especially bad in the area where I grew up. I grew up in
[Scarsdale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarsdale,_New_York), which is
near [New York City](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City).

I have lately noticed that some people, particularly some particular people
who grew up in other countries, are much better at dealing with bureaucracies.
And I have read that other people in America are
[more scared of police](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/03/letter-from-black-america-police-115545.html      
)
than I am.

Here are a couple situations that contribute to my suspicion that organizations
are worse in the places where I grew up.

### Immigrations officiers and customs officiers
The only difficulty I have ever had going through immigration or customs
ever was at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York City. Perhaps we should
add that the only other time I saw anyone else have trouble was on Amtrak
entering the United States through Niagara Falls (also in the state of
New York), where everyone on the
car who didn't have United States citizenship (and that happened to be
almost everyone) had trouble.

Contrast this with absolutely every other time I have moved between countries
during my entire life; it was always fine! I am always a bit scared when I go
to another country because I know that I'm going to have to go through
immigration and customs when come back into the United States. I'm pretty sure,
though, that this is particularly bad in John F. Kennedy Airport, so I'm just
going to enter through a different airport next time.

### Middle School
It seems that something shifted around seventh and eighth grades
(12 to 14 years old).

I often say that
elementary school was worst, middle school less bad, high school even
less, university even less, not-school even less. Teachers, students, and
administrators were much more mean in the lower schools, there was much
more homework in the lower schools, and I found the topics of study
more interesting in the higher schools and after university.

Given what I'm thinking about at the moment, I find it quite interesting
that the shifts were sudden---they were more about the school than about
the grade/age.

I remember concluding in seventh grade that school administrators
weren't really going to do anything about how other students were taking
my things and hitting me. Administrators can't do very much about it,
(Or, it would be a lot of work to do something about it, and they may
risk losing their jobs.) and they said they would do stuff about it
because that's what they're supposed to say.

Here's my present guess as to what is going on. The social status (that is,
power, authority, &c.) of young people gets higher as they get older and move
to higher grades in school; there is a bigger gap in status between the
supervized and the supervisors when the supervized are in elementary school
than when they are in high school. With increases in this gap also come
decreased accountability for the supervisors, and this lack of accountability
is much of my frustration with organizations.

### Running away from fights
This conclusion about my powerlessness was quite a relief as it led quickly
to the following corollary:
I can't control whether bad stuff happens to me, and nobody else is going to
help, so it isn't worth even trying to protect my self or my things.

I amended this over the past year or so:
There is one thing that you can do, and that is to
run away from the fighting. That's sometimes pretty hard, of course,
(For example, school is pretty much required until you're 16 in the
United States.) but at least it sometimes works.

You can see this in my reluctance to go to big cities, my disillusion about
[real work](/!/career-advice/), and my interest in [dada](/!/dada/).

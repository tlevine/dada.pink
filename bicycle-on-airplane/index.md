On March 26, 2015, I rode my bicycle from Schipol airport to Amsterdam
city center. It was quite amusing.

My bicycle got somewhat damaged on its way to Schipol. It seems that
my front rack is messed up on the right side (and maybe on the left,
but I'm not sure), my front wheel is out of true, and the
thing that the right pedal attaches to is bent such that I can't screw
the pedal back in. I didn't check whether the frame was bent.
It looks like something pressed really hard from the right side against
the bottom-front of the bicycle.

Here starts the amusement. I checked my bike without substantially
disassembling it and packing it nicely in a box. I had read that such
boxes might not be that effective, so one didn't seem worth it, given
the inconvenience. I estimate that the cost of repairs will be less
that that of a box and about as inconvenient, so not getting a box was
*still* a decent idea. Unless the frame is bent. That could be bad.

The damage didn't seem that bad at first, and that the ride to town
wasn't that long, so I rode it anyway. I put the right pedal on, even though
it didn't go in all the way and was crooked, and I attached the
front-right pannier bag with a bungee cable. I tried not to push very
hard on the right side pedal.

The pedal came off pretty quickly. I tried putting it back in a couple
of times and then eventually just rode without it. I stayed in my
highest gear the whole way so I didn't have to pedal as much.

One of the times the pedal came off, I hurt my left thumb. I think I
hyperextended the joint at the base of the first metacarpal. Also, my
hands got a little bit cold eventually.

## On the convenience of a bicycle
Although many people had given rave reviews of cycling, I had refrained
until this past December from acquiring one as it seemed really big, and
I didn't want to have to carry it. But then I realized in December that
I could ride it instead of carrying it, and then it seemed rather
convenient, as I find booking and boarding public transit to be rather
stressful and inconvenient. (I'm fine with the ride.)

The appeal of a bicycle is that I can move between cities without using
public transit. Well, this is actually just the beginning; the bicycle
also makes it easier to go to places that aren't served well by public
transit.

Having the bicycle has been somewhat inconvenient since December, and
it has been too cold for me to want to ride it very far. (More precisely,
I'm fine with the cycling, but I didn't want to camp in cold weather.)
I was still somewhat on-the-fence about whether it was worth it, but I
figured that it would get more convenient in the warmer weather.

Separate from my bicycle acquisition, I had made appointments in Amsterdam,
Netherlands at the end of March and in Stockholm, Sweden at the end of May,
so I had planned on riding between them. But there's water in-between North
America and Europe, so I had to carry it across the ocean somehow. I couldn't
figure out the bicycle policies for cruise ships, and flying on an airplane was
so much cheaper, so that's what I took.

How amazing that a bicycle still manages to inconvenience me in the
Netherlands, where cycling should be super convenient!

learned helplessness

bureaucracies don't care about you

It's so much easier to spend a month learning to do something my self
than it is to hire someone to do it (even if it costs very little money).

I get the impression that bureaucracies are pretty bad everywhere and
that they're especially bad in the area where I grew up. I grew up in
[Scarsdale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarsdale,_New_York), which is
near [New York City](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City).

Under this reasoning, 

For example, 
the only difficulty I have ever had going through immigration or customs
ever was at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York City. Perhaps we should
add that the only other time I saw anyone else have trouble was on Amtrak
entering the United States through Niagara Falls (also in the state of
New York), where everyone on the
car who didn't have United States citizenship (and that happened to be
almost everyone) had trouble.

It seems that something shifted around seventh and eighth grades
(12 to 14 years old).

I remember concluding in seventh grade that school administrators
weren't really going to do anything about how other students were taking
my things and hitting me. Administrators can't do very much about it,
(Or, it would be a lot of work to do something about it, and they may
risk losing their jobs.) and they said they would do stuff about it
because that's what they're supposed to say.

This conclusion was quite a relief as it led quickly to the following corollary.
I can't really do anything alone

I often say that
elementary school was worst, middle school less bad, high school even
less, university even less, not-school even less. Teachers, students, and
administrators were much more mean in the lower schools, there was much
more homework in the lower schools, and I found the topics of study
more interesting in the higher schools and after university.

Given what I'm thinking about at the moment, I find it quite interesting
that the shifts were sudden---they were more about the school than about
the grade/age.

Here's my present guess as to what is going on. The social status (that is,
power, authority, &c.) of young people gets higher as they get older and move
to higher grades in school; there is a bigger gap in status between the
supervized and the supervisors when the supervized are in elementary school
than when they are in high school. With increases in this gap also come
decreased accountability for the supervisors, and this lack of accountability
is much of my frustration with organizations.

It turns out that I
[could report this to the airline](http://www.norwegian.com/en/customer-services/travel-information/baggage-/baggage-handling/) and possibly get some money for the damage,
but I didn't. Why didn't I?

The person at the baggage claim told me I couldn't, but this isn't a reason
in itself. When he told me this, I knew that a thrifty and reasonable person
should keep asking different people until someone told me yes, as nobody in
a big organization knows the rules.

I figured that the airline probably wouldn't give me anything and that this
would be just as pointless as any other interaction with big organizations.
Moreover, big organizations scare me, and I expect to need to play games to
get anything from of them, even when it's just the service that I paid for.

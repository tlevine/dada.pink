I have a [Ribz Front Pack](http://www.ribzwear.com/ribz-front-pack/),
and it's *great*. I knew I wanted something like a backpack but for
the front, and this was the only one I could find. Well I actually found
[another](http://www.pacsafe.com/camsafe-v11-camera-front-pack-3.html),
but it looked far too clunky, had unnecessary security features, was
rather expensive, and didn't have many big pockets.

I want to see if there's anything else I missed. So I looked again, and
here's what I found.

* [Salomon Custom Front Pocket](http://www.salomon.com/us/product/custom-front-pocket.html)
* [LuxuryLite Front Hydration Pack](http://www.luxurylite.com/frontpackindex.html)
    (a bit too small)
* [Seek Outside Gateway Front Pack](http://store.seekoutside.com/gateway-front-pack/)
    ([a review](http://www.hikingthetrail.com/2013/08/gear-review-gateway-front-pack/))
* [Raidlight Front-Pack Trail](http://www.raidlight.com/en/portage/229-frontupack-trail.html)

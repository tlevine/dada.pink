My calendar is spread across a few pal files.

* [Activities with durations](http://small.dada.pink/activities.pal)
* [Sleeping arrangements](http://small.dada.pink/sleeping.pal)
* [Things to do any time](http://small.dada.pink/to-do.pal)
* [Travel arrangements](http://small.dada.pink/travel.pal)
* [Postponed](http://small.dada.pink/postponed.pal) (These don't show up when I run `pal`.)

There's also a private file, as explained in the
[operations](/operations/) page.

description: Do people I know from university use this structure more than other people?
--------------------------------------------------------
# (Subject) will be (gerund)

I get the feeling that people who went to
[Cornell University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University),
or maybe just people who lived in
[Risley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risley_Residential_College)
use the following grammatical structure more often than other people do.

    (subject) will be (gerund)

For example, we (I'm in the above group.) are more likely than others
to construct the following sentence.

> I'll be driving home at 6:00 pm.

Here are some other sentences with similar meaning and different structure.

* I am driving home at 6:00 pm.
* I am going to drive home at 6:00 pm.
* I'll drive home at 6:00 pm.
* I shall drive home at 6:00 pm.
* I will drive home at 6:00 pm.

Is this really a thing?

<!--
More specifically, I think that this group of people is more likely than
other groups to use the above structure to describe short events.

Preferences about where I live
=================================
It turns out that I do have preferences about where I live!
I have grouped them into things that are very hard to change
(like geology) and things that are less hard to change
(like city planning).


Very hard to change

Cool climate
    I prefer slightly cooler climate than most people do, I think. I realized this when Ana Maria told me about small towns.
Flat topography
    I like walking when it's easy. I don't like hills. I noticed this when hiking with Bryan near Seattle, which was a good contrast to Berlin.

Kind of hard to change

Quiet
    I like when it's quiet. That is, building systems, automobiles, and so on should be quiet; music shouldn't be turned up very high; and people should talk quietly.
Varied demographics, especially age
    I get scared when everyone seems the same.

Convenient things

Walkable
    I'm fine with walking a long distance, so most places that people consider bikeable are walkable to me. The main thing is that I shouldn't need a car. This is partly because I've read a lot about the dangers of cars and partly because I don't want to need to deal with one.
Easy to get to other places

Cheap

Here are places that Rachel (if I'm remembering her name correctly) said I should at least see.

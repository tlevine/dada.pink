Preferences about where I live
=================================
It turns out that I do have preferences about where I live!
I have grouped them into things that are very hard to change
(like geology) and things that are less hard to change
(like city planning).


Very hard to change

Cool climate
    I prefer slightly cooler climate than most people do, I think. I realized this when Ana Maria told me about small towns.
Flat topography
    I like walking when it's easy. I don't like hills. I noticed this when hiking with Bryan near Seattle, which was a good contrast to Berlin.

Kind of hard to change

Quiet
    I like when it's quiet. That is, building systems, automobiles, and so on should be quiet; music shouldn't be turned up very high; and people should talk quietly.
Varied ages of people
    I prefer neighborhoods where people of many different ages are living. For example, I would prefer living among families than among young professionals or old retirees. (Even better, I would live among all three!)
Easy to find places to do basic human things
    I find it difficult to do much else when I am hungry, when I need to urinate/defecate, or when I'm tired. (By the way, it's interesting that there's no adjective for the middle of these.)
    One way to have this is for my house to be right next to all the things I want to do.
    Another way to have this is for bathrooms to be easy to find and for sleeping and eating in public places to be acceptable.

Convenient things

Walkable
    I'm fine with walking a long distance, so most places that people consider bikeable are walkable to me. The main thing is that I shouldn't need a car. This is partly because I've read a lot about the dangers of cars and partly because I don't want to need to deal with one.
Easy to get to other places

Cheap

Here are places that Rachel (if I'm remembering her name correctly) said I should at least see.

* Mauratius


If I am to commute to work in a city, I should make sure that I can find
a seat on public transit during rush hour. This might involve living near
the end of the public transit (bus, train, &c.) line.

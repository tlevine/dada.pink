I had been hearing a lot about metaphorical data mining, but I never
knew much about the literal mining that the data were being compared to.
So I went to the Ruhr to learn more.

## Mining museum
I took the scenic cycle route along the Rhine and the Ruhr rivers and
watched the coal power plants pass by. Then I went to the
[German mining museum](http://bergbaumuseum.de/) in Bochum. It was
totally the best museum ever. There you can learn about the history of
mining in the area and about how all of the mining tools work. They also
have examples of the smaller machines and mine infrastructure and models
of the bigger machines. (By "smaller", I mean things that can fit inside
a building, so usually less than 10 meters long.)

You can see all kinds of support systems, ride an elevator down a
simulated kilometer, touch the cutters on tunnel-boring machines, see art
about mining, stand inside an excavator bucket, and so much more.

The main impression I got from this museum was that mining is really
big and stupid, in all possible senses. To start, some forms of mining
involve removing rock from a kilometer below the earth and replacing the
rock with wooden supports (or with other rocks, if the rock being removed
is coal).

Also, mining contraptions all do the same few things; the newer ones
are just faster and bigger and better and more safe. You have to dig to the
coal, pump water out of the ground, cut the coal up, then move the coal
to the power plant, and try to make this ridiculous endeavor slightly less
dangerous.

## Vocabulary
I learned some German at the mining museum. For example,

* schaufelradbagger
* ...

## Coal mine
Then I went to the Tagebau Hambach and saw real-live bucket-wheel excavators!

I also saw Old Manheim. It's mostly unoccupied now and being rebuild nearby as
New Manheim; there's coal under Old Manheim, so Old Manheim and the surrounding
land is going to be dug up entirely to expand the tagebau and get to the mine.
The government also moved a highway so that the old highway could be dug up and
added to the mine.

I would love know what it was like when RWE first announce that it was going
to make such a mine.

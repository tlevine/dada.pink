# Data glasses
I want new glasses. I just got new short-distance glasses a few months
ago, but my long-distance glasses are ten years old and are very scratched.
I never previously gave much thought to glasses when purchasing them.
Maybe open data can help me!

## Searching
Let's start by searching for datasets about glasses, lenses, frames,
optometrists, and so on.

* "[optometrist](http://openprism.thomaslevine.com/#/optometrist/1)"
* "[glasses](http://openprism.thomaslevine.com/#/glasses/1)"
* "[eyes](http://openprism.thomaslevine.com/#/eyes/1)"
* "[lens](http://openprism.thomaslevine.com/#/lens/1)"
* "[contact lenses](http://openprism.thomaslevine.com/#/contact lenses/1)"
* "[lenses](http://openprism.thomaslevine.com/#/lenses/1)"

## Results
It was hard to find anything. Oh, the
[difficulties of searching for data tables](/!/searching-data-tables/)!
I did manage to find some vaguely relevant things.

* [General Ophthalmic services workforce statistics](http://data.gov.uk/dataset/general_ophthalmic_services_workforce_statistics)
* [Choosing And Caring For Contact Lenses](http://datahub.io/dataset/sylvest)

## Anti-climax
Oh fiddlesticks. I guess I'll go back to searching
[all of the internet](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=choosing+glasses), not just
the open data.

On the plus side, the search for
"[lenses](http://openprism.thomaslevine.com/#/lenses/1)"
somehow led me to
[this exciting dataset](http://www.opendata-hro.de/dataset/vornamen_von_neugeborenen_2013).

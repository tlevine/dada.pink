I want new glasses. I just got new short-distance glasses a few months
ago, but my long-distance glasses are ten years old and are very scratched.
I never previously gave much thought to glasses when purchasing them.
Maybe open data can help me!

Let's start by searching for datasets about glasses, lenses, frames,
optometrists, and so on.

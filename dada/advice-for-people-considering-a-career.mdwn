[[!meta title="Advice for people considering a career"]]

Perhaps you are considering a career, maybe in "data science",
or maybe something else. I have some advice for you.



money

debt

mates

friends

neurosis

you actually like doing the thing



The only reason to start a career is for the money.

There are better ways to deal with the other things.

If you actually like doing the thing, you can already do it;
you don't need a special status, position, institutional affiliation,
&c. to do it.

If you actually like doing the thing and need some special
status, position, institutional affiliation, &c., you should
question whether you actually like doing the thing and whether
you really need the special status; you're probably wrong about
one of these two claims.

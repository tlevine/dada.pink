Thomas Levine likes to [sleep](/!/sleeping/), and he's usually
curious about why people do anything else.
His favorite color is [pink](/img/me-420.png).

## History
Playing with computers since he was young, Thomas eventually developed back and
wrist pain, and then he started studying ergonomics.
His back and wrists now hurt less.
At some point, people started calling him a data scientist.

## Computer toys
When he isn't sleeping, Tom sometimes makes things that reduce work and give
him more time to sleep and socialize. His main trick is to articulate an
intuition in math and then repeat stupid things
[many](/!/searching-data-tables-better/)
[many](/open-data)
[times](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pluplusch).

He also seems to
[like](http://small.dada.pink/dadawarehouse/README)
[people](http://small.dada.pink/whom-to-email/README).

He usually doesn't like talking about computers, or at least not in the
way that people usually talk about them. It's about as interesting as talking
about how to sharpen a pencil---probably fun once in a while, but boring
if it's all that people ever want to talk about, especially if there isn't
anything interesting to write about with your sharpened pencil.

## Teaching
Thomas apparently knows a lot about computer stuff. Talk to him if
you want to [learn something](/dada/learning-data-stuff/).

I recently noticed that I *really* like sleeping, enough
that I think of it as a major motivation in life.

My favorite feeling in life might be the one that comes
after I wake up from a nice sleep to sunlight, non-extreme
temperature, and generally pleasant surroundings. I'm pretty
sure that the surroundings need to be pleasant while I'm
sleeping too, but the feeling is more apparent when I'm awake.

## How to sleep
I seem to know some tricks to sleeping that other people don't.

### Sleeping for a long time
There are some tricks for if you want to sleep for like a day
straight.

Fill up several bottles of water, and leave them by your bed.
This way, you won't go thirsty for days.

You will still have to pee, so be careful not to wake up too
much when you do that. Get up as soon as you feel the need to
use the toilet, but be otherwise slow about it.
* Slowly walk to and from the bathroom without opening eyes
* 

## General

* Mouth above stomach
* Always sleep if you're tired
* Falling asleep quickly

## Hearing protection

* Earmuffs
* Ear plugs


## Sleeping without a bed
Use a **pillow**. When I'm sleeping on my back, the pillow needs
to be a bit less that two inches tall, I think. It needs to be more
like four inches tall if I'm sleeping on my side. I usually use
books, sweaters, jackets just because they're easy to find and
adjust. Bricks are quite nice if you can find one of the perfect
size.

To check whether I've sized and adjusted my pillow appropriately,
I try to snore as I adjust the pillow; if I manage to snore,
I adjust the pillow until I can't snore.

If it's light where you are, **cover your eyes** with sweater or
shirt or something. I particularly like large, soft, sweaters.
I use the body of the sweater for the pillow, and I wrap the
sleeves around my eyes.

I also like to **cover my hands**, especially in the winter, because
it doesn't feel nice when they get cold, dirty, or dry.

### Postures
Let's talk about three categories of posture and how I accomplish
each of them, especially when I don't have a bed.

I think I fall asleep fastest when I start out with **lying on my side**.
To do this comfortably, I like having an appropriately sized pillow for
my head, an even larger thing to put the higher of my arms on, and
another thing to put the higher of my legs on. If I don't have a thing
for the arms or the legs, I think I spread out my arms or legs,
respectively. I also sometimes let my arm fall towards the back of my
body; that is, laterally rotate my arm.

  * Semi-supine
  * Lying on your side without your hips hurting


## Broader sleepiness
When I say the word "sleep", I often mean things that might
not be literal sleeping, like lying in the grass or sitting
in a living room.

I seem a bit less interested in career-type things than
other people and often say that I want to retire.

I was in Oakland, California between May and November
of 2013. Everyone (or so it seems) has potluck dinners on Sunday
nights in the Bay Area, so I was of course at
[Matt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Mattsenate)'s
potluck dinner with other people I knew from
[Sudo room](https://sudoroom.org/). A few of us stayed overnight and found
ourselves sitting around the kitchen on a Monday. And
that was odd.

Someone asked, "**Are you all striking because BART isn't?**"
([Bay Area Rapit Transit](http://www.bart.gov/)
workers had been considering a strike.)

One of us had just quit his job, another has never had a
real job, another had a real job that she didn't have to
go to a place for, and I was working part time.

**Yes**, we're on strike against boring work! Or we're just retired,
because work is too much work.

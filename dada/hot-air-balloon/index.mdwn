I want to make a hot air balloon.

What material?
[Ripstop nylon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripstop#Ripstop_nylon)?
[Dacron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_terephthalate)?
It looks like I can buy both of these from a normal fabric store.

Maybe [RFduino](http://www.rfduino.com/) for communications?


I could put it on a string so I don't need a parachute valve and so
that it's easier to control.

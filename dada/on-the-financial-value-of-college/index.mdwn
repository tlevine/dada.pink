## Hype about the merits of college
A friend sent me an newspaper article called
"[Want proof college is worth it? Look at this list of the highest-paying majors](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp/2014/09/29/want-proof-college-is-worth-it-look-at-this-list-of-the-highest-paying-majors/)",
and that article discusses an article by 
[Brad Hershbein](http://www.hamiltonproject.org/about_us/our_people/brad_hershbein/)
and [Melissa S. Kearney](http://www.hamiltonproject.org/about_us/our_people/melissa_s._kearney/)
called "[Major Decisions: What Graduates Earn Over Their Lifetimes](http://www.hamiltonproject.org/papers/major_decisions_what_graduates_earn_over_their_lifetimes/)".

The friend just graduated from college. She mentioned that she didn't have
any financial support from her parents for college and that she is now earning
more in her entry-level job than her parents ever made.

## Financial value of college
Brad and Melissa's article doesn't discuss whether going to college is likely
to make people money in the long run, so I'm going to discuss that here in
relation to their findings.

The article discusses how much money people earn across their lifetimes and
how it relates to the major they had in college.

> The researchers estimate that even when college costs are taken into
> account, the median early childhood education major still makes 10 percent
> to 15 percent more than the median American with just a high school degree.

("Proof" is a rather strong word that I like to reserve for artificial settings
like math, but let's ignore that part of the title.)



## Quantitative research as religious texts
Brad and Melissa's article provides some interesting insights into the
how much money people make, but it does not address the "proof that college
is worth it" that might have attracted the readers of online newspapers.

entry-level job than her parents ever made.

I imagine that she managed to find some financial support from somewhere, so
college might have been worth it in pure money terms in her case.

This is part of a pattern that I see rather often: The biggest advocates for
a thing are usually the people who are hoping that they made the right choice.

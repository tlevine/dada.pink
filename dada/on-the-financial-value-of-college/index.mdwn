A friend sent me an newspaper article called
"[Want proof college is worth it? Look at this list of the highest-paying majors](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp/2014/09/29/want-proof-college-is-worth-it-look-at-this-list-of-the-highest-paying-majors/)",
and that article discusses an article by 
[Brad Hershbein](http://www.hamiltonproject.org/about_us/our_people/brad_hershbein/)
[Melissa S. Kearney](http://www.hamiltonproject.org/about_us/our_people/melissa_s._kearney/)
called "[Major Decisions: What Graduates Earn Over Their Lifetimes](http://www.hamiltonproject.org/papers/major_decisions_what_graduates_earn_over_their_lifetimes/)".

The friend just graduated from college. She mentioned that she didn't have
any financial support from her parents for college and that she is now earning
more in her entry-level job than her parents ever made.



The article discusses how much money people earn across their lifetimes and
how it relates to the major they had in college.

> The researchers estimate that even when college costs are taken into

("Proof" is a rather strong word that I like to reserve for artificial settings
like math, but let's ignore that part of the title.)



## An interesting pattern
The friend just graduated from college. She mentioned that she didn't have
any financial support for college and that she is now earning more in her
entry-level job than her parents ever made.

This is part of a pattern that I see rather often: The biggest advocates for
a thing are usually the people who are hoping that they made the right choice.

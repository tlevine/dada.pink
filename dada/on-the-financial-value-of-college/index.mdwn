## Hype about the merits of college
A friend sent me an newspaper article by
[Jeff Guo](http://www.washingtonpost.com/people/jeff-guo)
called "[Want proof college is worth it? Look at this list of the highest-paying majors](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp/2014/09/29/want-proof-college-is-worth-it-look-at-this-list-of-the-highest-paying-majors/)",
and that article discusses an article by 
[Brad Hershbein](http://www.hamiltonproject.org/about_us/our_people/brad_hershbein/)
and [Melissa S. Kearney](http://www.hamiltonproject.org/about_us/our_people/melissa_s._kearney/)
called "[Major Decisions: What Graduates Earn Over Their Lifetimes](http://www.hamiltonproject.org/papers/major_decisions_what_graduates_earn_over_their_lifetimes/)".

The friend just graduated from college. She mentioned that she didn't have
any financial support from her parents for college and that she is now earning
more in her entry-level job than her parents ever made.

## Financial value of college
Brad and Melissa's article doesn't discuss whether going to college is likely
to make people money in the long run, so I'm going to discuss that here in
relation to their findings.

Brad and Melissa discuss how much money people earn across their lifetimes and
how it relates to the major they had in college.

> Over the entire working life, the typical college graduate will earn $1.19
> million in todayâ€™s dollars [2].  This is more than twice as much as the
> lifetime earnings of a typical high school graduate ($580,000), and $335,000
> more than that of a typical associate degree graduate. Figure 2 shows median
> lifetime earnings for select majors, including those with the highest
> earnings, those with the lowest earnings, and those that are among the most
> common. As can be seen in the figure, lifetime earnings vary widely across
> majors. Over the entire career, the highest-earning majors will earn about
> two-and-a-half times what the lowest-earning majors will earn, a range from
> over $2 million for some engineering majors to about $800,000 for early
> childhood education. 

Jeff summarizes this as follows.

> The researchers estimate that even when college costs are taken into
> account, the median early childhood education major still makes 10 percent
> to 15 percent more than the median American with just a high school degree.

Brad and Melissa briefly considered tuition costs.

> Even if [$102,000] were subtracted from career earnings, it would still be
> the case that median net lifetime earnings in every major would exceed those
> of the median high school graduate. 

[Another Hamilton Project article](http://www.hamiltonproject.org/files/downloads_and_links/06_college_value.pdf),
by [Adam Looney](http://www.hamiltonproject.org/about_us/our_people/adam_looney/)
and [Michael Greenstone](http://www.hamiltonproject.org/about_us/our_people/michael_greenstone/)
estimated the average cost of a college degree to be $102,000.

Adam and Michael spend longer considering whether a college degree makes money
and concluded that it does. More precisely, it is a better investment than the
stock market, corporate bonds, gold, &c. Adam and Michael's analysis uses
averages rather than medians, so their numbers are higher for everything. Also,
they don't consider the details of lifetime earnings. (Presumably, that is part
of why Brad and Melissa did their study.)

## Relating tuition and earnings in more detail
Brad and Melissa have much detail on earnings and little detail on tuition.
Oppositely, Adam and Michael have little detail on earnings and much detail
on tuition. Let's consider both earnings and tuition. In order to be so
detailed and still finish this in time to have lunch, however, I'm going to
make you collect the empirical data.



## Quantitative research as religious texts
Brad and Melissa's article provides some interesting insights into the
how much money people make, but it does not address the "proof that college
is worth it" that might have attracted the readers of online newspapers.


The friend just graduated from college. She mentioned that she didn't have
any financial support for college and that she is now earning more in her
entry-level job than her parents ever made.

I imagine that she managed to find some financial support from somewhere, so
college might have been worth it in pure money terms in her case.

This is part of a pattern that I see rather often: The biggest advocates for
a thing are usually the people who are hoping that they made the right choice.

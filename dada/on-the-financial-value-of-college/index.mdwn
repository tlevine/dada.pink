## Hype about the merits of college
A friend sent me an newspaper article by
[Jeff Guo](http://www.washingtonpost.com/people/jeff-guo)
called "[Want proof college is worth it? Look at this list of the highest-paying majors](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp/2014/09/29/want-proof-college-is-worth-it-look-at-this-list-of-the-highest-paying-majors/)",
and that article discusses an article by 
[Brad Hershbein](http://www.hamiltonproject.org/about_us/our_people/brad_hershbein/)
and [Melissa S. Kearney](http://www.hamiltonproject.org/about_us/our_people/melissa_s._kearney/)
called "[Major Decisions: What Graduates Earn Over Their Lifetimes](http://www.hamiltonproject.org/papers/major_decisions_what_graduates_earn_over_their_lifetimes/)".

The friend just graduated from college. She mentioned that she didn't have
any financial support from her parents for college and that she is now earning
more in her entry-level job than her parents ever made.

## Financial value of college
Brad and Melissa's article doesn't discuss whether going to college is likely
to make people money in the long run, so I'm going to discuss that here in
relation to their findings.

Brad and Melissa discuss how much money people earn across their lifetimes and
how it relates to the major they had in college.

> Over the entire working life, the typical college graduate will earn $1.19
> million in todayâ€™s dollars [2].  This is more than twice as much as the
> lifetime earnings of a typical high school graduate ($580,000), and $335,000
> more than that of a typical associate degree graduate. Figure 2 shows median
> lifetime earnings for select majors, including those with the highest
> earnings, those with the lowest earnings, and those that are among the most
> common. As can be seen in the figure, lifetime earnings vary widely across
> majors. Over the entire career, the highest-earning majors will earn about
> two-and-a-half times what the lowest-earning majors will earn, a range from
> over $2 million for some engineering majors to about $800,000 for early
> childhood education. 

Jeff summarizes this as follows.

> The researchers estimate that even when college costs are taken into
> account, the median early childhood education major still makes 10 percent
> to 15 percent more than the median American with just a high school degree.

Brad and Melissa briefly considered tuition costs.

> Even if [$102,000] were subtracted from career earnings, it would still be
> the case that median net lifetime earnings in every major would exceed those
> of the median high school graduate. 

[Another Hamilton Project article](http://www.hamiltonproject.org/files/downloads_and_links/06_college_value.pdf),
by [Adam Looney](http://www.hamiltonproject.org/about_us/our_people/adam_looney/)
and [Michael Greenstone](http://www.hamiltonproject.org/about_us/our_people/michael_greenstone/)
estimated the average cost of a college degree to be $102,000.

Adam and Michael spend longer considering whether a college degree makes money
and concluded that it does. More precisely, it is a better investment than the
stock market, corporate bonds, gold, &c. Adam and Michael's analysis uses
averages rather than medians, so their numbers are higher for everything. Also,
they don't consider the details of lifetime earnings. (Presumably, that is part
of why Brad and Melissa did their study.)

## Relating tuition and earnings in more detail
Brad and Melissa have much detail on earnings and little detail on tuition.
Oppositely, Adam and Michael have little detail on earnings and much detail
on tuition. Let's consider both earnings and tuition. In order to be so
detailed and still finish this in time to have lunch, however, I'm going to
make you collect the empirical data.

### Two investment choices
Because they adjusted for inflation, we can think of Brad and Melissa's
lifetime earnings data can be thought of as a lump sum of money that you
recieve when you stop working. Because you probably spent all of your
college money within a few years (rather than across a lifetime), let's
think of that as money that you invest when you are 20 and get some
yearly return on.

Let's assume that you make absolutely no money if you don't go to college.
You probably would make some money, but this makes the math easier.

Imagine that you are concerned only about money and that you have decided
to invest a certain amount of money (Call it "college tuition", even though
it includes your housing and food and whatnot.) when you are 20 and then
cash in your investment when you are 65. You may choose between two
purchases: college or the stock market. Which one should you choose?

I've made the plot below to help you with that.

### Calculating your costs
Brad and Melissa converted earnings figures into
[2014 dollars](http://www.hamiltonproject.org/files/downloads_and_links/MajorDecisions-TechnicalAppendix2.pdf).
If you are going to college or went to college recently, you can consider that
the value of the dollars you spent on college is approximately the same as it
would have been in 2014. If not, adjust the tuition for that. (Multiply your actual tuition cost by 1.02, *n* times, where *n* is the difference between 2014 and the year you paid the money)

If you took out loans, estimate the total interest that you will pay. If you
expect that it will take more than like five years to pay back all the loans,
adjust for inflation. (Divide each loan payment by 1.02 *n* times, where n is the number of years between when you received the money and when you paid back the money.)

You can decide whether to consider just your college tuition or the sum of
your tuition, housing, food, &c.

### Your earnings
Figure out how much you are earning, guess how much you are going to earn,
and/or look up in Brad and Melissa's paper how much your major is expected
to earn.

### An example
Let's use me as an example, because I'm curious about what I'll find.

I spent $100,000 on college.

<img alt="Tom spent $100,000 on college."
     src="tom-expenses.png"
     class="wide" />

I didn't see "ergonomics" in Brad and Melissa's paper, and the only "design"
is "graphic design", so let's say that I'm "multidisciplinary science".

<img alt="We predict that Tom will earn $1.15 million through his life."
     src="tom-predictions.png"
     class="wide" />

I just drew lines for my expenses and predict earnings; this point is
their intersection.

<img alt="Tom's college expenses and his predicted lifetime earnings"
     src="tom-both.png"
     class="wide" />

Now let's put that pink dot on top of the first plot I drew.

<img alt="How Tom's investment compares to alternatives"
     src="tom-comparison.png"
     class="wide" />

It looks like my situation was quite typical. I spent $100,000 on college,
and Adam and Michael found $102,000 to be the average expense.
Multidisciplinary science majors earn on median
[$1.19 million](http://www.hamiltonproject.org/files/downloads_and_links/FINAL_MajorDecisions-Appendix_Table_2.pdf) over a lifetime,
and this is also the median across all majors.

Recall that this calculation assumes that I make **no money** if I don't go
to college. That is, it does not consider that people with high school degrees
and no college degree make $580,000 on median.
In my situation, instead of going to college and then working, I could have
invested $100,000 in the stock market and **retired**.

### Usual disclaimers
All of [Brad and Melissa](http://www.hamiltonproject.org/files/downloads_and_links/MajorDecisions-Appendix_001.pdf)'s cautions still apply, of course.

## Quantitative research as religious texts
Brad and Melissa's article provides some interesting insights into the
how much money people make, but it does not address the "proof that college
is worth it" that might have attracted the readers of online newspapers.


The friend just graduated from college. She mentioned that she didn't have
any financial support for college and that she is now earning more in her
entry-level job than her parents ever made.

I imagine that she managed to find some financial support from somewhere, so
college might have been worth it in pure money terms in her case.

This is part of a pattern that I see rather often: The biggest advocates for
a thing are usually the people who are hoping that they made the right choice.

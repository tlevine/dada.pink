## Broader sleepiness
When I say the word
"[sleep](/!/sleeping/)", I often mean things that might
not be literal sleeping, like lying in the grass or sitting
in a living room.

I seem a bit less interested in career-type things than
other people and often say that I want to retire.

I was in Oakland, California between May and November
of 2013. Everyone (or so it seems) has potluck dinners on Sunday
nights in the Bay Area, so I was of course at
[Matt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Mattsenate)'s
potluck dinner with other people I knew from
[Sudo room](https://sudoroom.org/). A few of us stayed overnight and found
ourselves sitting around the kitchen on a Monday. And
that was odd.

Someone asked, "**Are you all striking because BART isn't?**"
([Bay Area Rapit Transit](http://www.bart.gov/)
workers had been considering a strike.)

One of us had just quit his job, another has never had a
real job, another had a real job that she didn't have to
go to a place for, and I was working part time.

**Yes**, we're on strike against boring work! Or we're just retired,
because work is too much work.

I've been collecting lots of data for the past ten years or so,
and I've recently been connecting those data in my
[dada warehouse](http://small.dada.pink/dadawarehouse/README).
I think I'll manage to do some of the things that I want to do
with it, but it is becoming clear that many of these things are
harder than I had hoped.

## Using an off-the-shelf data warehouse product
I originally thought I was going to do this with
[cubes](http://cubes.databrewery.org/), but then I couldn't get cubes
to work on even the examples that the documentation references.
Fortunately, it is free software, so I read through the code and
changed a few things and generally tried to understand how to use it,
but I eventually gave up.

Then I figured that I could use some other data warehouse thingies.
It turns out that that is even harder! First of all, you usually have
to figure out how to buy them, and that turns out to be *really* hard.
Some of them have free trials, so I tried those, but I didn't manage
to install any. I got hope when I saw [Saiku](http://meteorite.bi/saiku/)
because it is free software, but I didn't manage to install it either.

So I eventually gave up and wrote my own thing. I call it
[doeund](http://small.dada.pink/dadawarehouse/doeund/)
(because I name things by
[banging on the keyboard](/dada/dada/)).

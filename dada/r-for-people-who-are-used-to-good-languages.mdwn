People make different languages ofr different reasons...
Here's how you should think about R.

1. The thing about R is that it was designed by statisticians.
2. Everything in R is a complete hack.
3. People who use R only know how to use R.

I don't really know whether the above statements are true,
but R makes a lot of sense when you assume that they are.




People who use R only know how to use R.
Shiny is the best example of this; people who use R only know how
to use R, so when they want to write websites, they need their own
domain-specific templating language written in R.
(That said, there are good reasons to use Shiny too.)


When someone says he or she knows R, it usually means that he or she
knows how to load data from a CSV file, fit whatever model he or she
uses in his or her work, and then make a plot.



dynamically typed

magic things based on types and dimensions

weird things

S3 classes, S4 classes

dots in names rather than underscores

Functions usually don't have side effects.
(And you should try not to use side effects as that can be confusing.)

Weird names

* `apply`
* `list`

R is really slow, but the parts written in C and Fortran are fast, so
it is good practice to "vectorize" your code. For example, this

    vec <- 1:100
    vec.2 <- vec + 1

is much faster than iterating through `vec` and adding 1 to each element.

`data` packaging

`?`

`sos::findFn`

Function syntax `y ~ x`

plotting

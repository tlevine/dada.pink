## The only way to acquire lots of money is to steal it.
Business and money started to make a lot more sense to me when I
started thinking of it all as institutionalized robbery.

At some level, we use money as a means of exchange, so that I can
more easily trade my goats for pants, beets, pink hair dye, and
all of the other things I need.

### Stealing is fine in small doses
It's unfortunate that "steal" has a bit of a negative connotation;
I wanted a word for "take without giving something in return", and
it was the only one I could come up with. You see, to say that we
shouldn't steal at all would be to question our existance.

We don't really make our own food, for example; trees grow our food
for us, and we're okay with not giving them much back in return.
And the trees don't make the food out of nothing; the energy comes
from the sun, and the trees don't have a moral obligation to do much
for the sun. The sun's energy comes from destroying mass, and it
doesn't feel obligated to give anything back to the hydrogen atoms.
It's turtles all the way down.

As far as I know, humans (and all species on Earth) have been stealing
in small doses since they've been around. We eat things that we see
lying on the ground, we pluck things off of plants and eat them, and
we even hunt animals and then eat them. And other things steal from us,
forming any number of wonderful cycles that you might have read about
in a textbook.

It's totally fine to steal if we let things replenish after we steal
from them. Conversely, we should let things steal from us as long as
they do it in small doses.

## Practical
If I'm making less than $500 per day (arbitrary figure from 2014),
definitely should avoid work. Work might be worth it if you're
making a lot more than that.

The exception is if you're getting paid to do something that you'd do for
free. And I mean you would *really* do it for free. Like, if you were starving,
you would choose to do it rather than taking a job. I am skeptical that anyone
would pay me for this sort of stuff, but if they did

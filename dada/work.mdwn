### Stealing is fine in small doses
It's unfortunate that "steal" has a bit of a negative connotation;
I wanted a word for "take without giving something in return", and
it was the only one I could come up with. You see, to say that we
shouldn't steal at all would be to question our existance.

We don't really make our own food, for example; trees grow our food
for us, and we're okay with not giving them much back in return.
And the trees don't make the food out of nothing; the energy comes

for the sun. The sun's energy comes from destroying mass, and it
doesn't feel obligated to give anything back to the hydrogen atoms.
It's turtles all the way down.

I wear a burqua to drag parties.

<!-- Insert image here. -->

This is hilarious for a few relatively superficial reasons.

* Nobody else does it.
* It's a lot more convincing than other drag.
* Even though it conceals me, it is totally obvious that I'm under it as
    nobody else would ever do it.

But its real hilarity comes from a deeper troll.

The garment offends the hippie liberal Americans who say that it is a symbol of repression
of women by extreme forms of Islam and that it is not funny. This stereotypical American
doesn't realize how awesome burquas are, portrays extreme Muslims as immoral pigs, and overestimates
how many Muslims of this sort exist.

Conversely, my wearing of the garment offends those extreme Muslims that
those hippie liberal Americans oppose. Because I'm at a drag party.

It's funny enough that I'd manage to offend these two opposing groups.
It gets even more hilarious when you consider that
I am the most modestly dressed of anyone at the party;
with everyone else dressed as stereotypical sluts or pimps,
I'm the last person with whom you should take offense.

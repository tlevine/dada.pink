Which of the three XLR pins do I connect? That is, do I use the negative
polarity wire and the positive polarity wire or the negative polarity wire
and the shield? I determined that I should use the latter combination based
on the possibility of [phantom power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_power);
if I used the shield, a rather strong potential difference would exist, and
something would probably break.

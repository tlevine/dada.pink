I thought to write this piece after learning from Matt Linares about
neuro-linguistic programming. I remarked that I pay attention to the
same sorts of things (without having a name for them) but with a
slightly different focus.

Manipulation and deception are often discussed as involving two groups
or persons: the person doing the manipulation and the person being
manipulated. I think of these practices as being more fundamentally
about the controlling person. That is, when person A is manipulating
person B, it is really that person A is manipulating himself or herself;
person A's implicit goal in controlling person B is to validate person
A's thoughts or feelings.

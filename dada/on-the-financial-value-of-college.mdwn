A friend sent

to me.


## An interesting pattern
The friend just graduated from college. She mentioned that she didn't have
any financial support for college and that she is now earning more in her
entry-level job than her parents ever made.

This is part of a pattern that I see rather often: The biggest advocates for
a thing are usually the people who are hoping that they made the right choice.

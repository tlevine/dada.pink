Looking around on the internet today, I came up with a fun idea.
Instead of spending $200,000 or more on college in the United States,
you could use that money to demonstrate financial ties to Belgium,
move to Belgium, obtain Belgian citizenship in five years, and then
go to university for relatively nothing.

More about some specific countries
=======================================
I started looking into this after coming across a
`company that sells citizenship to rich people <http://best-citizenships.com/>`_.
This company rates different countries on the ease of obtaining citizenship
and the value of obtaining citizenship. There are many companies like it.

Unfortunately, the sources for their claims as to the costs of citizenship
are usually not cited, so I looked around further.

Belgium
--------------------------------------
I looked around on Belgian government websites and came up with several things.

And I looked around a bit more and found a bit more.

I get the feeling that the whole system is grossly complicated and
that nobody understands it; people probably pay lots of money for
other people to figure it out for them.

### Hungary
Hmm. http://www.akk.hu/object.E2A89FF4-D355-4173-9252-C8F50FD17F04.ivy

Portugal
--------------------------------------
You can obtain a
`Golden Residence Permit <http://www.sef.pt/documentos/56/ARIEN2.pdf>`_
by spending about about three
American university tuitions on a property in Portugal.
I presume that you can invest in an apartment building and live
in it and rent it out and use that to pay for all of your other
expenses.

Live there for a few years, and then you can apply for citizenship.

Investing savings in citizenship
======================================
I started thinking about all this when I noted that citizenship in
many countries provides more rights than citizenship in the United
States and that this has an impact on living costs. For example,
the following things are all less expensive.

* University (That said, I don't particularly care for higher education.)
* Healthcare
* Housing (usually, at least I think)

It might be a good idea to make money in the United States and then
to move to Europe to retire and raise a family.

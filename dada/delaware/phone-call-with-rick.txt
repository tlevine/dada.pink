The sample is the thing you can buy for $20.

Direct Web Access gives you the same stuff for a better price and a seamless interface; the other states feed something similar, and the vendors provide everything in one interface, in one common look and feel.

The $10 thing is the "Status", like "Good Standing".

To be a Direct Web Access vendor, you need to be a commercial registered agent
and have demonstrated one year of being an on-line registered agent
http://corp.delaware.gov/agents/agts.shtml

They have direct online access. They can upload information for approval.

80% of filings get filed through a registered agent company, rather than directly
through the division. A lot have the online access and do the database entry and
then submit for approval. And they scan the image of the document.


There's really only two parent companies offering a subscription to
Direct Web Access; there used to be more, but they've been consolidated

CT CSC
CT Corporation
Corporation Service Company
two-thirds of legal entities are represented by them


By contract, registered agents have access to the database solely for the purposes
of serving their clients. They are prohibited from using it in bulk. There's a fee
to be an online registered agent, and there are special technologies, so there's a
big upfront cost. There isn't a fee for purposes of being a registered agent, but
there is a fee for conveying information to a third party (the $10 and $20 fees).

Their imaging system has the document images, and those have other fees ($10 for the first page, $2 for each additional page).

All those fees are in the statute. 

* Title 8 Section 391 (fees)
* Title 6 Chapters 15 (partnerships), 17 (limited partnerships), 18 (LLCs)
  * doesn't remember the subsection
* Title 12 Chapter 38 (statuatory trusts)
* Title 29 Chapter 23 Section 2318 (Direct Online Access)

General Assembly comes up with the fees and has theh authority to raise revenu.
They used to provide no free information over the internet

Third-party access goes back to early nineties.

in 2003 or 2004 decided to provide some information for free so they wouldn't get so many phone calls

The fee structure for online access was maybe 2003 or 2004 that it was constructed

about 3.1 million legal entities (because it goes all the way back to 1899)

about 1,050,000 active entities

biggest per capita, but california, ny, florida are even bigger in raw size

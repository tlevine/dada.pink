## Awards
* National Science Graduate Research Fellowship Program honorable mention

## Consulting work
Since graduating from university (May 2011), I have worked as a data science
consultant, helping organizations take advantage of data. My services include

* Data strategy, architecture
* Converting data formats (that is, extract, transform, load)
* Connecting disparate datasets
* Presenting data for normal people (through websites, visuals, [music, and food](/sensing-data))
* Training around data science tools and concepts

I typically start with questions from clients, translate those questions into
math, and obtain the empirical data that the model requires.

### Data for investing
For [Vy Capital](http://vycapital.com/), a venture capital firm,
I developing large-scale data acquisition systems to drive
investment decisions (2014).

### Fraud detection
I built a system for detecting suspicious behaviors in procurement
processes for the Integrity Vice Presidency of the
[World Bank](http://worldbank.org/) (2014).

### Searching across spreadsheets
I studied patterns in the publishing of disparate spreadsheets and developed
some tools to assist in searching across many different spreadsheets (2013--2014).
[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i10Fj0bZIis) summarizes my
conclusions decently.

Relatedly, but separately, I developed specialized data search tools for
[Ontodia](http://www.ontodia.com/)'s
[Pediacities](http://nyc.pediacities.com/) data encyclopedia (2014).

### Software engineering
I worked on [DataPad](http://datapad.io)'s data analysis product (2013).

I worked on [ScraperWiki](https://scraperwiki.com) data processing
infrastructure and build specialized data processing systems (2012).

### Data management
I developed and continue to maintain a system for gathering and refining data
to assist the environmental advocacy efforts of the
[Gulf Restoration Network](https://healthygulf.org/) (2012--present).

### Data collection
As part of [csv soundsystem](http://csvsoundsystem.com),
I did engineering and product management on [treasury.io](http://treasury.io) (2013).

I collected data about the locations of finance institutions to assist the
[Microfinance Information Exchange](http://mixmarket.org) with
[mapping the financial sector](http://www.themix.org/publications/mix-microfinance-world/2012/05/mapping-financial-sector-south-africa) (2012).
<!-- They use these data to understand who has access to financial products
in order that people make more informed investment decisions regarding microfinance. -->

### Teaching
I developed the curriculum for [Zipfian Academy](http://zipfianacademy.com)
and taught the first class of students (2013).

For [ScraperWiki](https://scraperwiki.com),
I also taught short courses on the cleaning and analysis of data. (2012)

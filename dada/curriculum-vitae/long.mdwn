## Research interests
**Sharing of datasets**.
I studied patterns in the publishing of disparate spreadsheets and developed
some tools to assist in searching across many different spreadsheets (2013--2014).
[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i10Fj0bZIis) summarizes my
conclusions decently.

## Volunteer work and other collaborations
**Data collection**
(February 2013 to December 2013, two days per month)
As part of [csv soundsystem](http://csvsoundsystem.com),
I did engineering and product management on [treasury.io](http://treasury.io)

**Wetlands**.
(May 2012 to present, one day per month)
I assist [Gulf Restoration Network](https://healthygulf.org/)'s
environmental advocacy efforts by developing and maintaining an
end-user system for gathering, refining, and integrating data on
wetlands in Louisiana.

## Professional service
I have reviewed submissions to

* [csv conf](http://csvconf.com/)
* [Ergonomics](http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/terg20)

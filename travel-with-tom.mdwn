I don't know what to do all day, so one of the things I wind up doing
is going to pretty places that are far away from the last pretty place
that I was at. In many cases, I would like to have a buddy.

1. Having a buddy makes it more fun.
2. Walking at night is sometimes less scary with a buddy.
3. The cost of a hotel is less outrageous when it is split in two,
    and the cost is on par with a hostel if it is split in three.

The third is the kicker for me.

I like pretty things, and I'm usually up for anything pretty if it's
cheap enough and I know about it in time to schedule things. If you
just want to go somewhere cool but don't know where, tell me, and I'll
give you a few options.

Do you want a travel buddy? If yes, let's collaborate; send me an
[email](mailto:thomaslevine.com). If no, read about the extra benefits
of travelling with me, and see if you change your mind.

## I can carry stuff for you
The above reasons might be enough for you to want to have me as a
travel buddy. But there is one reason why you want to have
*me* specifically as a buddy: I can carry things for you. What I can
carry depends on the mode of transit.

### Foot and public transit and airplanes
Until recently, all of the stuff I took with me when I moved house
fit in this backpack.

![(Picture of the backpack.)]()

This backpack contains some **things that I will happily let you use**.

* Laundry detergent
* Pens, pencils
* Hand warmers (I'm considering removing them, though.)
* Micro USB cables
* Toothpaste
* Soap
* Sunscreen
* Shampoo
* Conditioner
* Hair wax
* Empty front pack (in case I acquire more things)

With these above things, you can easily *free up two liters* of space
in your backpack. And if you rely on hand warmers, you can replace a sweater
or jacket, which would free up *another two liters*. Furthermore, you can
use my front pack in case of emergencies, giving you yet *another 11 liters*.

(This backpack also contains things that I'm not going to let you use,
like clothes and toothbrushes.)

In addition, **I can carry stuff for you**. I wouldn't want to do this for
a particularly long period, but I am quite happy to carry stuff on an
*airplane*, for example. Since I have virtually no stuff, this nearly
doubles your capacity.

### Bicycle
I recently got a bicycle, and the bicycle unfortunately doesn't fit
in the backpack.

![(I'll put a picture here eventually.)]()

On the other hand, I have lots of storage space on my bicycle.

* Two pannier bags on the front wheel
* Two pannier bags on the back wheel
* Room on the front wheel and handlebars for a big bag
* Room on top of the back rack and panniers for a big bag
* Room on my body for a backpack and frontpack.
* A frame bag

At the moment, all bags are empty except the two front pannier bags,
each of which has a capacity of 14 liters. These front pannier bags
are each about two-thirds full. Here's what's in them.

* Everything that had been in my aforementioned backpack
* Bike tools
* An empty backpack, an empty frontpack, and a few empty stuff sacks

This leaves me with *lots* of space.

* 26 liters in each back pannier
* 19 liters in the backpack
* 11 liters in the frontpack
* about 20 liters in the front stuff sack
* about 20 liters in the back stuff sack, or easily 50 liters if I get a bigger bag

That's about 90 liters if I don't wear anything on my back and don't go
crazy, 120 liters if I add a top bag, and 150 liters if I also wear the
backpack and frontpack.

**You can take advantage of this space**! My stuff fits in 20 liters when
we exclude the bike tools. If you're sloppy and can fit your stuff in 40
liters, this is still enough for me to carry stuff for *three people*.
If you want to go camping, I can carry a tent, your clothes, and some
cooking stuff, and you'll just need to carry the sleeping bags. In either
case, you can go on a cycle tour without a good bicycle, as long as you
don't mind going slowly.

## If you don't need me to carry stuff
Things can be really hilarious if you don't need me to carry stuff.
One person with only a small bag is strange enough, but two!?

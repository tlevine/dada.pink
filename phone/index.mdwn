# Calling Tom

If you're in the United States, you probably want to call
[+1 229 516 1541](tel:12295161541).

If you're in another country or the above number is otherwise a long
distance number, you can call [+883 51000 9902082](tel:883510009902082),
which should be a local call. This is an iNum, which is supposed to be
effectively a local numbers regardless of where you are in the world.
Many providers don't implement that properly, however, so it doesn't
always count as a local call. To ensure that it is local, you can use an
[access number](http://www.inum.net/what-is-inum-2/local-access-numbers/)
for the region you are calling me from. Here are
[directions](http://www.inum.net/call-inum-from-your-cell-phone/)
for saving the combined access number and iNum in your phone.

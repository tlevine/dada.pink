secret: True
title: My recent apathy about open openness
description: It seems that I don't get excited in the ways that people think I will.
--------------------------------------------------------

People Tweeted at me a lot yesterday about things that didn't
excite me in the ways that they probably had anticipated.

## Open data open data
A conversation started around studying how people use websites
that let you download spreadsheets (open data catalogs).
[Luke's writing](http://govfresh.com/2014/07/time-open-data-open-data/)
sort of prompted the discussion, and Luke eventually asked if anyone
wants to
[do something](https://twitter.com/lukefretwell/status/497379906175524864)
around this topic of study. I'd rather [sleep](/!/sleeping/).

It would be easy for me to look at
[all kinds of things](/open-data/)
on this topic, but I still don't manage to get myself to do very much.

I get the feeling that nobody cares
very much about any of the stuff that I'm doing; they're only pretending.
And this includes
[all](http://codeforamerica.org/)
[of](http://sunlightfoundation.com/)
[those](http://data.gov/)
[organizations](http://ckan.org/)
[that](http://socrata.com)
[preach](http://nucivic.com/data/)
[open](http://www.code4sa.org/)
[openness](http://thegovlab.org/).
It would be less confusing if they just didn't fake interest in my stuff.
Or maybe it would be fine if their pretending involved helping with this stuff,
but it doesn't.

Well actually, that's not true;
some people really really like what I'm doing
becaue it's confirming what they already think,
which is that the openly open openness is
"[fucked](https://twitter.com/lifewinning/status/489712000055144449)".

## Related projects
I [alluded](https://twitter.com/EllieAsksWhy/status/497277750466863104)
to a related thing that I'm vaguely working on. I figured that a decent
source of information about how these open data sites are used would be
the web server logs for these websites.

I've in fact been sitting on [datahub.io](https://datahub.io) server logs
for some time. I have many ideas of interesting things I could do with them,
but I still don't do any of them. I don't think people care that much, I'm
certainly not going to get paid for it, so I'd rather just
[sleep](/!/sleeping) instead.

## Why do people get excited about this stuff?
Other people seem a bit more excited about this openly open openness nonsense
than I do. Here's what I think is going on, and it's not specific to
open-whatever.

People want to feel like they're part of something big, so people organize
themselves into
[things](http://www.codeforamerica.org/)
[that](https://okfn.org)
[sound](http://www.socrata.com/)
[big](http://thegovlab.org/)
or try to win
[fancy](http://www.law.berkeley.edu/17363.htm)
[competitions](https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2014/07/21/2014-17065/vizrisk-prize-competition-challenge).
Or maybe they move to San Francisco and start companies
(which might just be [websites and business cards](http://www.whitbygroup.com/))
that are going to invent some other "technology" that isn't about open openness.

People who are looking for some direction and purpose in life get sold on
some sexy work. Then they decide that they need to save the world with the
open openness or whatever the work is, so then they devote their
lives to one of big and impressive projects/entities. It might feel nice at
first, but I don't think that people find the purpose that they are looking
for in such endeavours.

## There isn't money in this stuff
Is open data really [all about the money](/!/open-data-is-all-about-money/)?
Maybe it isn't, and maybe just say it is because we know that
numbers and money will be our saviour and that
you are silly if you think otherwise. Moreover, if it were all about the
money, you'd think that [it would pay](/!/searching-data-tables-better).

Fortunately, it does! As of last week you can work at
[a tenth of minimum wage](https://twitter.com/thomaslevine/status/497272565770231808)
to collect [data](https://usodi.org/2014/08/01/openaddresses)
for fancy innovative businesses that are going to save the
world by making lots of money and being more important than you.

## Silly games
I went to
[Open Knowledge Festival](http://2014.okfestival.org/)
for the first time last month, and I found it to be the most
stressful thing I'd done in a while. The previous similarly
stressful thing was
[Transparency Camp](http://transparencycamp.org/);
the ambiguity and pointlessness of all this openness become
unpleasanly clear when when you get a bunch of people together
to be open about openness.

I like being around people who make me feel nice, and the people
who care about open openness sometimes do this; that might be
[why I do this stuff](/!/datakind-is-kind/). But I wish I didn't
have to care about fixing government or saving the world. And
computers are [kind of nice](/!/why-i-like-hackerspaces/),
but [I don't really like talking about them](/!/learning-data-stuff/).

I like the people, but playing these games is a lot of work, and
I'd rather have time to [sleep](/!/sleeping/).

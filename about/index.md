About Thomas Levine
=====================

![A picture of Tom](/static/tom-pictures/2014-12-11.jpg)

I like to [sleep](/!/sleeping/), and I'm usually
curious about why people do anything else.
When I'm not sleeping, I like to do things that let me sleep more.

## Ergonomics
I apparently know something about
[ergonomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_factors_and_ergonomics).
I have made assembly lines for fun since as long as I remember,
and I noticed that it was weird only at university while I was
making a snow fort with some other people.

My back and wrists started hurting when I was about 13. It might
have had something to do with me playing cello and using computers
a lot. Then I started reading and doing ergonomicsy things related to
how backs and wrists work. And then my back and wrists didn't hurt as
much. And then I went to university and got a degree in ergonomics.

## Computer
I'm apparently pretty good with computers too. When I'm not sleeping,
I often make computer things that do my work for me so I have more time
to sleep.

I usually doesn't like talking about computers, or at least not in the
way that people usually talk about them. It's about as interesting to me
as talking about how to sharpen a pencil; it's fun once in a while, and
but I'm usually more interested in the thing I'm writing with the pencil
than in advancing pencil-sharpening techniques.

## Records
I write often about things that I'm thinking about or doing. This has some
neat [side effects on social interactions](/!/hypermediated-conversation/), and
it has something to do with my [approach to teaching](/!/tom-computer-school/).

It seems also that I pay unusually much attention to why and how

## Teaching
The sort of teaching that people talk about is a
[lot of work](/!/learning-data-stuff/),
so here is how I like to teach people instead.

Do your own project or whatever, and try to learn the things that you
think you need to learn. If there's something that is taking you a while
to figure out, try to avoid learning it. If you can't avoid learning it,
ask someone (so maybe me) for some help with that thing.

Recall that this thing was hard to learn and also so important that you
couldn't avoid learning it. How unfortunate that something so important
is so hard to learn! How fortunate that you can change that!

If you ask me and I think I can help, I'll meet with you in person or
over the phone or something and try to explain. During our session, we'll
take copious notes on everything we did. If you finally understand the
thing, we (or, preferably, you) might consider making something that
helps other people understand this confusing and important thing.

Preferably, this thing will not involve much work from a teacher.
For example, videos, drawings, and writings are great.
Activities like classes and games are also good if you record them
somehow, like by taking a video, sharing notes, or writing directions
for the activity.
(If I do it, I'll probably
[write](/!/street-sign-protocol)
[something](/!/downloading-binary-files-is-not-magic/).)
Here's an example of

My main trick is to articulate an
intuition in math and then repeat stupid things lots of times.
This might be why people started calling me a data scientist.

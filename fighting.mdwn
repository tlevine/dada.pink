> People fight because they feel like fighting.

More precisely, in order for someone to fight, she must have both
a desire to fight and a thing worth fighting for; and it's easy for
someone to find one of these once she already has the other.
I emphasize the desire to fight as an equal component to this because
people tend to focus on the thing worth fighting for.

# Things I learned about cycling recently
I recently have been reading and listening a lot about bicycles.
Very relatedly, I [got a bicycle]()
four months ago (December 2014).

Here I discuss some things I have learned.

## Misconceptions about cycling

Here are some misconceptions about cycling that


### You do have to carry your bicycle, and it's not easier to carry stuff on the bicycle
I held off a long time from getting a bicycle because I didn't want to carry
the bicycle. Then I somehow convinced myself that it I could ride a bicycle
instead of carrying it and that it would be pretty easy to take a bicycle on
a train or airplane. Also, I thought it would be easier to carry stuff because
it would be in pannier bags on racks rather than on my back.

I thought it would be easier

### Cycling long distances isn't hard
The main actions of pedaling and navigating a bicycle for a long distances
is not hard. I still have no idea what people are talking about when they
say that a bike tour is difficult on the body.

Let me say that more precisely. If I walk with only a few things in my bag
and take breaks periodically, I will be unpleasantly tired after three hours.
On the other hand, I can cycle all day with 40 pounds of baggage (still with
periodic breaks). I'll be tired at the end, but it won't be as bad as three
hours of walking.

And if we're comparing based on distance it's even crazier. Three hours of
walking is about ten miles. I could do that on ten miles on bike without sweating.

I got this bicycle four months ago, and I haven't ridden it much. Before
getting the bicycle, I walked a lot. If you really do ride bicycles or
exercise or something, bicycle would probably be super easy.

## Things that were right

### On the Netherlands being good for cycling
People often remark that the Netherlands has
[outstanding cycling infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_in_the_Netherlands).
This remark ignores that the Netherlands has good transportation infrastructure
in general.

The Dutch have higher standards for quality of life than I am used to.
You might say that they are "spoiled". For example, to the Dutch, 20 minutes
is a long tram ride, and 1 hour is a ridiculous car ride. The mother of one
Dutch friend was distraught upon learning that her daughter was going to move
20 kilometers away for school.

Furthermore, when something is less than stellar, the Dutch do something about
it, rather than merely accepting what they get.

The good cycling infrastructure came about because...

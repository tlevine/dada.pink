# Backpack
What backpack will satisfy my desires?
My backpack must meet these criteria.

* Comfortable (easy to carry)
* At least one big pocket with at least three small, zippered, internal pockets
* At least six small, zippered, external pockets
* Loops for trekking poles
* Acceptable for carriage on public transport
* Small, because big things scare me

Zippered pockets are so that I trust that things don't fall out. Or I'll at
least notice if things do fall out.

Also, it should meet these criteria.

* It facilitates the carriage of stuff in the front.
* It has a place to hang wet clothes to dry.

Now that I know what I want, let's find it.

## Can I buy it?
Let's look at some off-the-shelf backpacks.

* I have the Tom Bihn Synapse 19.
* [Haglöfs Tight XS](http://www.haglofs.com/gb/en/gb/en/Backpacks-and-Bags/TIGHT-XS/p/293001.2LT) has only one pocket but has compression strap, nice for clothes, and comes in pink.
* [Haglöfs Corker Small](http://www.haglofs.com/gb/en/Backpacks-and-Bags/CORKER-SMALL/p/339200.2D4) has one pocket only, I think, and comes in pink.
* [Quechua ARP 10](http://www.quechua.co.uk/arp-10-backpack-pink-id_137476)
* [Bird vest](http://www.badlandspacks.com/birdvest-hunting-pack.html) could
    work well in concert with another backpack.
* [Typohoon](http://www.maxpedition.com/store/pc/TYPHOON-BACKPACK-3p1577.htm)
    has lots of pockets but looks scary.
* You can clip extra pockets to the
    [Condor backpack](http://www.maxpedition.com/store/pc/CONDOR-II-BACKPACK-109p106.htm),
    so I could have my clothes in the extra pockets and drop them off at home, for example.
* Arcteryx Ascent Cierzo 18
* Deuter Trans Alpine 26 (24?)
* Deuter Futura 22 or 18

But I also want it to be easy to carry.
Here are ideas.

* [StackPack](http://www.luxurylite.com/stackpackindex.html)
* [MetroWild](http://www.metrowild.com/)
* Deuter Futura 22 or 18

Maybe I can modify one, or just add store-bought pockets?

* [Adding pockets](http://sectionhiker.com/adding-pockets-to-ultralight-backpacks/)
* [Shoulder strap pockets](http://www.mountainlaureldesigns.com/shop/product_info.php?cPath=46&products_id=71)
* [Pack pockets](http://www.mountainlaureldesigns.com/shop/product_info.php?cPath=46&products_id=70)
* [UL pack lid](http://www.mountainlaureldesigns.com/shop/product_info.php?cPath=46&products_id=95)

I want pockets in the front. This stuff looks good.

But I'm still not pleased.

Sammi pointed me to diaper bags. Their pockets are too big and don't have zippers.

## How to make it
I think that what I want is quite close to a conventional external frame pack,
except not as wide nor big nor sturdy. Heavy stuff goes in the top pouch, with
internal pockets at the bottom for the precious things, and the external pockets
go underneath.

Or, since I don't need much space, it could just be a [hat](/!/hatpack/).

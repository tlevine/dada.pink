# My life is so weird
I already knew, of course, that my life was so weird,

(tiana)

but it has become particularly clear this past few weeks.

## Understating myself
I often understate my abilities/accomplishments. This can lead to
hilarious incidents, especially when I don't realize that I'm understating
myself. I think this is my way of dealing with imposter syndrome.

### "Do you have a GitHub?"
Sometimes people give me career advice or interview me for jobs. In these
situations, people sometimes ask, "Do you have a GitHub?". If people are
giving me career advice, they're telling me that I just need to publish a
couple projects on GitHub and then I'll have an easy time finding a job.
If people are interviewing me, they want to see if I have any sample code
to show them.

I usually pretend that GitHub doesn't exist because it's proprietary, but
yes, I do [have a GitHub](https://github.com/tlevine). If you asked for it,
it's probably a lot more impressive than you expected.


### "Have you heard of [this organization]"?
I often come across as a naïve kid who doesn't have much experience in life
and is figuring out what he wants. Because I am. But I'm also a lot less naïve
than it might seem; if tell me about an organization that I might want to work
for or at least talk to, there's a decent chance that I know half the people
there.

I have
[heard]()
[of]()
[DataKind]().


### Ergonomics
I don't talk much about ergonomics, at least not by that name, but it comes
up once in a while. Sometimes people start talking about usability, about
proper furniture sizing, or about some other ergonomicsy topic, and the
discovery that they are sitting next to an ergonomics export is usually a
fun surprise.

At the RIPE Atlas hackathon, people thought I was a "designer" and that
I should team up with "developers". Oh boy.

### Life purpose
I have been telling people that I don't know what to do all day and don't
see a point in doing anything, and I'm apparently not clear enough about how
wonderful my life is; most of the advice I get is to travel in some distant
place, work odd jobs, volunteer for a non-profit organization that supports
a cause I care about, make art, make myself immortal, and meditate. I was
already doing pretty much all of these things. (I don't think I meditate,
but other people say I do.)

By Groningen, I again had little enough stuff that it fit in my back-pack
as long as I wore my jacket. Also, I got a fannie-pack, and that made it
easier for me to organize things and to pack. Which such few and organized
stuff, it was now quite easy for me to walk around all day without knowing
where I was going to sleep at night. And this I did.

# My life is so weird
I already knew, of course, that my life was so weird,

(tiana)

but it has become particularly clear this past few weeks.

## Understating myself
I often understate my abilities/accomplishments. This can lead to
hilarious incidents, especially when I don't realize that I'm understating
myself. I think this is my way of dealing with imposter syndrome.

### "Do you have a GitHub?"
Sometimes people give me career advice or interview me for jobs. In these
situations, people sometimes ask, "Do you have a GitHub?". If people are
giving me career advice, they're telling me that I just need to publish a
couple projects on GitHub and then I'll have an easy time finding a job.
If people are interviewing me, they want to see if I have any sample code
to show them.

I usually pretend that GitHub doesn't exist because it's proprietary, but
yes, I do [have a GitHub](https://github.com/tlevine). If you asked for it,
it's probably a lot more impressive than you expected.


### "Have you heard of [this organization]"?
I often come across as a naïve kid who doesn't have much experience in life
and is figuring out what he wants. Because I am. But I'm also a lot less naïve
than it might seem; if tell me about an organization that I might want to work
for or at least talk to, there's a decent chance that I know half the people
there.

I have
[heard]()
[of]()
[DataKind]().


### Ergonomics
I don't talk much about ergonomics, at least not by that name, but it comes
up once in a while. Sometimes people start talking about usability, about
proper furniture sizing, or about some other ergonomicsy topic, and the
discovery that they are sitting next to an ergonomics export is usually a
fun surprise.

### Learning
Some people my age are really into learning. If you just started working
a real job in a professional profession, you might be really excited about
learning how the field works, especially if you need to justify how badly
you are getting paid. And if you're working a more menial job, you might be
craving mental stimulation.

I don't particularly like talking about computers, and I look like a naïve
kid who doesn't know anything (because I am), so people sometimes assume that
I want to work a job where I'll learn stuff. Maybe data stuff. In reality,
I couldn't care less about learning; I think I have had enough of it.

### Data data computer computer

At the RIPE Atlas hackathon, people thought I was a "designer" and that
I should team up with "developers". Oh boy.

### Life purpose
I have been telling people that I don't know what to do all day and don't
see a point in doing anything, and I'm apparently not clear enough about how
wonderful my life is; most of the advice I get is to travel in some distant
place, work odd jobs, volunteer for a non-profit organization that supports
a cause I care about, make art, make myself immortal, and meditate. I was
already doing pretty much all of these things. (I don't think I meditate,
but other people say I do.)


### Critiques of my flippant behavior
When I say ridiculous things like [don't apply for jobs](/!/career-advice/),
[open data is a waste of time](/!/open-data-is-all-about-money/), or
[data scientists](/!/data/) are people who couldn't get jobs in academia
but want to feel like they're still doing research,
people think I don't know what I'm talking about and that I'm trolling.
Indeed I know almost as little about these topics as everyone else does,
but that's my way of saying that I actually do know something about this
stuff. It's a bit like this
[exchange](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/36mn9q/til_guy_bedford_creator_of_jspm_systemjs_es6/).
Someone remarked that a person had been working on some important free
software projects without pay, as if that was noteworthy.
[James](http://substack.net/) responded thusly.

By Groningen, I again had little enough stuff that it fit in my back-pack
as long as I wore my jacket. Also, I got a fannie-pack, and that made it
easier for me to organize things and to pack. Which such few and organized
stuff, it was now quite easy for me to walk around all day without knowing
where I was going to sleep at night. And this I did.

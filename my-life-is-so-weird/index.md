# My life is so weird
I already knew, of course, that my life was so weird,

(tiana)

but it has become particularly clear this past few weeks.

Bicycle, Düsseldorf

Stockholm

Sörmlandsleden

Bremen

Oldenburg

PyGrunn


By Groningen, I again had little enough stuff that it fit in my back-pack
as long as I wore my jacket. Also, I got a fannie-pack, and that made it
easier for me to organize things and to pack. Which such few and organized
stuff, it was now quite easy for me to walk around all day without knowing
where I was going to sleep at night. And this I did.

Amsterdam

Eindhoven, not *so* weird

Belgrade, weird only because of jobs

Sofia

"Are you in Serbia?"

Skopje

Someone asked me,

![Web form containing a question "In which city do you work?"](form-full.png)

I looked for [mythical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mythological_places)
cities with believable names. I wound up with four.

1. [Ys, France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ys)
2. [Camelot, England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camelot)
3. [Paititi, Brazil/Bolivia/Peru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paititi)
4. [Themiscyra, Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Themiscyra_%28mythology%29)

Which one do I want to be my city?

1. Ys thrived economically and whatnot and then started doing sinful
    orgies and got consumed by the sea. How appetizing.
2. Camelot is the castle of
    [King Arthur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Arthur)
3. Paititi is a [utopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_city).
4. Themiscyra is the capital of the
    [Amazons](htt[ps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Themiscyra_(mythology)).
    Hmm I'm male.

Utopia sounds like a nice place.

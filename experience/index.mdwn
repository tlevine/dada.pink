There's this vague idea that people need to do some work to
get experience or to take some courses in order to learn some
new skills and that that will help you advance in your career
and make more money and stuff. I think that people overestimate
the value of such up-front investments. Some relevant points:

* I'm apparently good at math and computers and "data" stuff,
    but rarely does anyone want to pay me much to do computer stuff.
* Older people don't seem to make much more money than younger people.
    It took me a while to realize this because people never talk about
    their salaries.
* Perhaps your background doesn't get you more money but instead
    gives you a fancier title/position. Why do you care about that?

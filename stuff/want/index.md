[things I want to do](/!/things-i-want-to-do/)

## Money
I want a prepaid debit card, because normal debit cards are supposedly
unsafe and normal credit cards confuse me too much. Here are some options.

* [American Express Serve](http://www.nerdwallet.com/prepaid/debit-cards/American-Express-Prepaid)
* [Bluebird by American Express and Walmart](http://www.bankrate.com/finance/banking/bluebird-by-american-express-walmart.aspx)
* [AccountNow](http://www.accountnow.com)

But maybe I don't want one, actually, because they seem just as confusing
as credit cards.

# Gifts and loans

I don't like when I have expensive things that aren't being used.
I try to give them away, but people seem to treat it more as lending.

## Already disseminated
I replaced my [earmuffs](/!/earmuffs/) with ear plugs and gave the
two pairs earmuffs to Matt Senate and Dorothy Howard, respectively.

I had an Aaxa P300 projector (with HDMI cable, and power adapter) that
I had previously found useful but have removed from my bag to keep
things small. And then I gave it to Anabel Church.

My bicycle and most of the accessories
[went](/!/cycling/)
to [Chaosdorf](https://chaosdorf.de/).

## Computers to give away
Relatedly, I want to give away my two desktop computers.
I have two bespoke, artisinal, quiet, hand-crafted-with-love
desktop computers.

One is in an Antec P180 Mini case. It has 16 gigabytes of RAM,
a decent CPU, quiet fans, and several hard drives.
It has lots of room or disk drives and PCI cards.
My father happens to want something like it, so I'm backing up
everything that's on it and am going to tell him how to fix it
up to be what he wants.

One has an Akasa Euler case. It has 16 gigabytes of RAM an SSD,
a decent CPU, and no room for disk drives. It presently has no
wireless network ability, but I have a wireless network card that
might work with it. It has no moving parts, so it's pretty quiet.
[These people](https://twitter.com/thomaslevine/status/439103995894697984)
seem interested in it.

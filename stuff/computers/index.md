# Computers

## Preferences
I'm starting to think that laptops are more portable than desktops.
This is what I want.

* Lots of RAM
* Cool-running CPU
* SSD
* Light

I want this too, but it's less important.

* Quiet (preferably with no fans)
* Big battery (less important)

Laptops produced in 2014 are way more powerful that I could possibly
need and not much lighter than 10-year-old laptops. With that in mind,
I see no reason to buy functional laptops; buy or otherwise acquire
broken laptops and replacement parts to fix them.

## Giving away
Relatedly, I want to give away my two desktop computers.
I have two bespoke, artisinal, quiet, hand-crafted-with-love
desktop computers.

One is in an Antec P180 Mini case. It has 16 gigabytes of RAM,
a decent CPU, quiet fans, and several hard drives.
It has lots of room or disk drives and PCI cards.
My father happens to want something like it, so I'm backing up
everything that's on it and am going to tell him how to fix it
up to be what he wants.

One has an Akasa Euler case. It has 16 gigabytes of RAM an SSD,
a decent CPU, and no room for disk drives. It presently has no
wireless network ability, but I have a wireless network card that
might work with it. It has no moving parts, so it's pretty quiet.

seem interested in it.

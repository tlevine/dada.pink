A benefit of having a house is that I don't have to carry all my stuff
with me. Here is how I plan on organizing my stuff when I have a house.

## Overview
My stuff is organized with the following principles.

* Packing for most activities should involve simply bringing the appropriate
    combination of bags with me, not packing bags specially for a particular
    trip.
* It should be convenient to bring my day bag when traveling; I should not
    need to switch it for another bag, as that involves moving its contents
    to another bag.
* I should look normal when I am traveling.
* I should look like I am traveling when I am moving house.

## Descriptions of the groups
I separate the stuff into a few groups. With each group I specify
what container I store it in, how it is composed, and when I use it.

### Day bag
I carry my day bag pretty much everywhere.
Here I list the straightforward things.

* Teeth things
  * Toothbrush
  * Smallest size toothpaste tube I can find
  * Normal floss
  * Floss for under my braces
  * Mouthwash in a [portable liquid container](#containers)
  * [Blue Lizard](http://www.bluelizard.net/) sunscreen in a portable liquid container
* Washing
  * Elumin shampoo in a portable liquid container
  * Powder container of powdered/[grated](http://groceryshrink.com/2011/04/homemade-powdered-laundry-soap.html) soap
  * [Powder container](#containers) of laundry powder
* Unique things
  * Wallet (money and cards of day-to-day relevance)
  * Retainer
* Other
  * Pens
  * Keys
  * Napkins
  * Empty plastic bags
  * Small paper notebook
* Water bottle
* Clothes (See the [extra clothes section](#clothes) for further specifications.)
  * One pair of socks
  * One pair of underwear
  * One long-sleeved shirt of fancy plastic (EMS Techwick)
  * Thin plastic windbreaker with lots of pockets
* Trekking poles

Here are some relatively expensive computer things it contains.

* Laptop (Acer Aspire One 725-0488) and power adapter
* GPS (Garmin etrex 30), mini-USB cable, and AA batteries
* Cheap GSM phone (Nokia something) and power adapter

For that plug into mains electricity, they should have the
appropriate plug for any country that I might go to within the next
few months.

#### Bag
The backpack itself has these characteristics.

* Loop to store trekking poles
* No padding for things like laptops (to save space and weight)
* Small size (about 20 liters) and weight overall
* Easy to carry, with a hip belt and stuff
* Maybe a frame, but the laptop can also act as a frame
* At least two small internal pockets
  * It would be benefitial for [travel](#travel) purposes to have a third
      internal pocket.
* Enough small outer pockets to organize the things as specified below
* Resists rain
* There is an easy way to attach wet clothes to the outside for drying.
    I must be able to attach two socks (one pair), one long-sleeved shirt,
    and one pair of underwear.
* Suitable for wearing on the front of the body (not just on the back, as
    is usually done)

#### Organization of the bag
The laptop and clothes go in the big pocket.

Unique things, phone, and GPS must all go in small internal pockets.
Minimally, they must be separated into two pockets, in which case the
unique things are in one pocket and the phone and GPS are in the another.
They may also be separated further.

Teeth things and sunscreen, washing, water bottle, and other
must all get their own external pockets. Teeth things are sunscreen are
separated from other toiletries because I need them more often.
A group may be separated across more than one pockets, but two groups
must not share one pocket.

Trekking poles go in the trekking pole loop.

<h3 id="clothes">Extra clothes</h3>
I need more clothes if I don't want to do laundry every night or
if I want more options.

All **materials** should be animal fibers, though fancy plastic (EMS Techwick)
is also acceptable. Materials must be either animal fibers or fancy plastic.
Clothes must also be very thin and warm. For example, a thin silk shirt is
acceptable, and a fluffy wool sweater is not.
The animal fibre for most things is likely to be merino wool.

And here's the list of the clothes.

* Three pairs of socks
* Two pairs of underwear
* Two pairs of long pants
* Two pairs of short pants
* Three long-sleeved shirts
* One sweater
* Two pairs of leggings
* One pair of barefoot shoes
* One pair of normal shoes

The clothes that I am wearing are *included* in the above list.

<h3 id="travel">Travel</h3>
If I go away for more than a day, I take with me the day bag and a few
other things. These other things are

* An empty front pack for extra space in an emergency and for separating
    dirty laundry (optional).
* One pair of socks (the ones I am wearing) and one more if I think I won't
    have much time for doing laundry.
* One long-sleeved shirt (the one I am wearing) and one more if I think I won't
    have much time for doing laundry.
* One pair of leggings
* The pants I am wearing
* Any sweaters, jackets, hats, &c. that I am wearing.
* Cash, identification, and other cards as appropriate for the places
    I am going
* Power adapters sufficient for charging one device (my laptop or phone)
    in North America, Britain, and Europe
* House shoes

To make this easier, I have a special bag of extra things just for travel.
To prepare for travel, I simply grab this extra bag. If I know I won't need
the extra space, I can also take just its contents. I may also remove mains
power adapters that I know I won't use.

The bag is the front pack
([Ribz Front Pack](http://www.ribzwear.com/ribz-front-pack/), small size),
and its contents are

* One pair of underwear
* One pair of socks
* One long-sleeved shirt
* One pair of leggings
* One pair of slippers or house shoes
* A larger stiff envelope containing
  * My passport
  * My birth certificate, and any
      other personal documents that I might ever need ever (not just for
      when traveling)
* A smaller stiff envelope or wallet containing
  * All public transit cards (MetroCard, Oyster Card, Tap Card, &c.)
      other than the one for the place I live
  * All of the cash that I own, of all currencies other than that where
      I live, plus some extra cash of the place where I live
* Ten AA batteries

#### Organization
These are stored like so.

* The smaller stiff envelope goes in the left small pocket.
* The larger stiff envelope goes in the left large pocket.
* Leggings go in the left large pocket.
* Power adapters go in the right small pocket.
* Everything else goes in the right large pocket.

In the above storage specification, left and right may be reversed.

While traveling, I might adjust the organization of clothes somewhat,
combining clothes I'm wearing, clothes from the day bag, and clothes
from the travel bag.

* All wet clothes hang from my backpack.
* Dry socks, underwear, and leggings all go in one of the two large pockets
    in the front pack.
* Dry shirts go in the other large front pack pocket.
* Outerwear that I am not wearing go in the large backpack pocket.
* Dirty clothes may be wrapped in a disposible bag to separate them. But it's
    usually not necessary.
* Stiff envelopes go in the backpack.

### Camping
Rather than a normal bed, I have a hammock as my bed and hammock quilts as my
blankets.

I use these for camping as well; I have a normal-size backpack (about 25 liters)
containing the following items

* Storage for water, either as water bottles on outside pouches or as a bladder
    with a tube
* Tarp for the hammock

To prepare for camping, I take my day bag, my travel front pack, and my camping
backpack. I use the day bag as a front pack. I put my travel front pack and my
hammock in either the day (front) bag or the camping (back) bag.

### Home stuff and spares
There are things that I keep at home. Collectively, these things should have
a volume of no more than about 40 liters. I group them into two categories:
spares and home things.

#### Spares
I have spares of all electrical chargers/cables/adapters, larger quantities
of teeth and washing things, and spare water bottles.

#### Organization
Spares are special compared to the other groups in that I rarely access
them. Thus, it is important that they be very well catalogued, as I otherwise
won't remember where everything is.

Pasted conspicuously in the suitcase should be a table listing each of the
items for which I should have a spare and whether

* I have no spares, even though I should have one
* I have only one spare, and I am using it elsewhere in the house
    (most relevant for teeth and washing things)
* I have at least one spare, and it is in the suitcase.

Teeth and washing things could spill and get messy, so they are stored in
a water-tight box at the bottom (wheel end) of a suitcase during
[transport](#moving-house). Everything else
should be stored in small bags with the same groupings as are present in
the day bag.

### Home things
Here are things that I only use at home.

* Kitchen tools, preferably portable
  * Frying pan
  * Sauce pan
  * Baking dish
* Things for parties, one thing for each guest and me
  * Large plate
  * Small plate
  * Large mug (doubles as a bowl)
  * Wine glass (doubles as a normal cup)
* Hair coloring products
* Nail polish
* Dremel
* Electric screwdriver
* Small fan for drying clothes
* Clothes line
* Tub for washing clothes

If I require it for my internet connection, I also have a modem and a router
and whatnot.

### Other furniture
The only furniture item that I have discussed so far is the hammock.
Other furniture includes chairs, rugs, couches, tables, and so on.
Preferably, these are all either very inexpensive (found on the street,
for example) or very easy to ship.

#### Portability
It would be very cool if this stuff all fit in one bag that I can check
on an airplane. It would be almost as cool if it fit in up to three
bags; that just means I have to take two airplane trips. This is discussed
further in the section on [moving house](#moving-house)

For example, chairs may be meditation cushions, and tables may have
legs that are easy to remove. Instead of rugs, I can simply have
several pairs of house shoes that other people can use (and I guess
a box to put the dirty house shoes so that people trust that the
shoes they are wearing are clean).

#### Specific items
My thoughts on specific items are quite tentative at the moment, but
here they are.

Some things are mainly for guests, and I have separated those things.
Let's say I want to be able to have up to five guests at a time
(six people including me). Here is what I would have.

Instead of carpets, I have six pairs of house shoes. To convince
people that I clean the shoes after they are worn, have a hamper
containing a seventh pair of house shoes. Maybe guests don't really
need these, but I need at least one pair for myself.

I have a dining table. In order that it be easy to ship and store,
the table separates into three sections, and the legs are easy to
remove. The table top is thin, and I have some way of switching
the height between eating height and computering height.

I have six chairs. Actually, maybe I have two benches, as this
could be easier to assemble and disassemble.

I have something like an sofa. This could be a normal sofa. More
likely, it is a rug and either a bunch of large pillows or a mattress
without a frame (maybe a futon). A mattress without a frame is appealing
as a bed for guests.

Kitchen counter and kitchen appliances are usually included in housing
rentals and are often included in houses. If I am to have my own, it is
not necessary that I be able to move them, as portable versions are
usually cheap enough that shipping them is only slightly cheaper than
buying new ones.

## Details on items
Here are some more preferences about specific items.

<h3 id="containers">Portable containers</h3>
Containers for liquids that I carry day-to-day must have between 10 and 30
milliliters of capacity and seal really really well. I have yet to find such
a container.

The best thing I have found is a cosmetic sample container. These are small
enough and seal slightly better than any other small container I have found,
but the seal still isn't great.

The portable liquid container might work just fine for powders as well.
But in case I want something different, powders get portable powder containers.

### Water bottle
I haven't quite decided what the water bottle should be. It should be light
and small, so the main contenders are disposible plastic bottles and the
[Vapur Element](http://vapur.us/element).

### Hair products
I prefer Elumin dye for my pink hair. Here are the relevant supplies.

* [Applicator Set](https://www.brightonbeautysupply.com/goldwell-elumen-tools-applicator-set.aspx)
* [Lock](http://www.brightonbeautysupply.com/goldwell-elumen-lock-6-7-oz.aspx)

<h2 id="moving-house">Suitcases, and how to move house</h2>
It is sort of obvious how you might move any of the things for which I have
specified a bag; put it in the bag and carry it. Inexpensive furniture and
home things may be given away instead of taken.

What about everything else?

### Theory
The general theory is that I should be able to move everything with one trip
on a train or plain, taking taxies to and from the train station or airport.
I must be able to move it all by freight, and I should choose that if it will
be cheaper than a train or plane.

The camping backpack has almost enough space to fit the day bag and travel
front pack inside it. That can go carry-on in the train or plane, with room
for another small bag. I might be able to take one or two additional
suitcases carry-on a train, but not on a train.

Anything beyond this needs to be checked or shipped.

### Details
The extra clothes, home stuff, spares, and other furniture go in suitcases
and get checked on the train/plane or get sent with freight service.

### How many suitcases
The extra clothes, home stuff and spares should all fit inside of one large
suitcase, with room to spare. That much stuff is likely to go over the weight
limit, however; it is better to fit it all in a small suitcase so that things
don't move around so much.

When packing this suitcase, I use the clothes as padding for everything else,
and I put things in bags to preserve their conceputal groupings.

What remains is furniture. Fewer bags is obviously better, but about how many
bags should I have? Let's think of this in three ways.

1. If I'm going to ship it freight, I can ship as many bags as I want and that
    it will probably cost between $20 and $200 per bag, depending on the
    specific trip.
2. Amtrak, Eurostar, and Thalys (just examples) presently (May 2015) allow
    a hand bag and two suitcases carry-on. So a limit of two suitcases would
    be nice.
3. Airlines usually charge substantially more for the third bag than the
    second bag, so a limit of two suitcases on airplanes would also be nice.

Weight is also an issue. Weight limits on airplanes are usually 50 pounds or
23 kilograms. Weight limits on trains are usually higher.

If the furniture is thoughtfully selected, it can definitely fit in three bags.
One bag is also possible, but it might need more planning.

A benefit of having a house is that I don't have to carry all my stuff
with me. Here is how I plan on organizing my stuff when I have a house.

## Overview
I separate the stuff into a few groups. With each group I specify
what container I store it in, how it is composed, and when I use it.

## Descriptions of the groups

### Day bag
I carry my day bag pretty much everywhere.

#### Contents
Here I list the straightforward things.

* Teeth things
  * Toothbrush
  * Smallest size toothpaste tube I can find
  * Normal floss
  * Floss for under my braces
  * Mouthwash in a [portable liquid container](#containers)
  * [Blue Lizard](http://www.bluelizard.net/) sunscreen in a portable liquid container
* Washing
  * Elumin shampoo in a portable liquid container
  * Powder container of powdered/[grated](http://groceryshrink.com/2011/04/homemade-powdered-laundry-soap.html) soap
  * [Powder container](#containers) of laundry powder
* Unique things
  * Wallet
  * Retainer
* Other
  * Pens
  * Keys
  * Napkins
  * Empty plastic bags
  * Small paper notebook
* Water bottle

Here are some relatively expensive computer things it contains.
I have [extras](#extras) of the chargers but not the main things.

* Laptop (Acer Aspire One 725-0488) and power adapter
* GPS (Garmin etrex 30), mini-USB cable, and AA batteries
* Cheap GSM phone (Nokia something) and power adapter

For that plug into mains electricity, they should have the
appropriate plug for any country that I might go to within the next
few months.

#### Bag
The backpack itself has these characteristics.

* Loop to store trekking poles
* No padding for things like laptops
* Small size (~20 liters) and weight overall
* Easy to carry, with a hip belt and stuff
* Maybe a frame, but the laptop can also act as a frame
* At least two small internal pockets
* Enough small outer pockets to organize the things as specified below

Here is how stuff fits into pockets.

Unique things, phone, and GPS must all go in small internal pockets.
Minimally, they must be separated into two pockets, in which case the
unique things are in one pocket and the phone and GPS are in the another.
They may also be separated further.

Teeth things and sunscreen, washing, water bottle, and other
must all get their own external pockets. Teeth things are sunscreen are
separated from other toiletries because I need them more often.

###

  * Two pairs of merino wool underwear

  * Fjalor Shqip FrÃ«ngjisht



Supplies

Sunscreen
    Blue Lizard
Instant soup
    Dried soup

  * Two things of nail polish

### More clothes
I need more clothes if I don't want to do laundry every night or
if I want more options. These go in a XXX.


### Extras
I have extras of almost everything in case I lose something.
If I do not have an extra of something, I say so when I specify the
thing above.

The extras are stored in an suitcase of airline carry-on size.

Extras are special compared to the other groups in that I rarely access
them. Thus, it is important that they be very well catalogued, as I otherwise
won't remember where everything is.

## Details on items

<h3 id="containers">Portable containers</h3>
Containers for liquids that I carry day-to-day must have between 10 and 30
milliliters of capacity and seal really really well. I have yet to find such
a container.

The best thing I have found is a cosmetic sample container. These are small
enough, but they seal only slightly better than any other small container
I have found.

The portable liquid container might work just fine for powders as well.
But in case I want something different, powders get portable powder containers.

### Water bottle
I haven't quite decided what the water bottle should be. It should be light
and small, so the main contenders are disposible plastic bottles and the
[Vapur Element](http://vapur.us/element).

### Hair products
I prefer Elumin dye for my pink hair. Here are the relevant supplies.

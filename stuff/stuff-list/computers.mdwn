I'm starting to think that laptops are more portable than desktops.
This is what I want.

* Lots of RAM
* Cool-running CPU
* SSD
* Quiet (preferably with no fans)
* Light
* Big battery

Laptops produced in 2014 are way more powerful that I could possibly
need and not much lighter than 10-year-old laptops. With that in mind,
I see no reason to buy functional laptops; buy or otherwise acquire
broken laptops and replacement parts to fix them.

I don't like when I have expensive things that aren't being used.
I try to give them away, but people seem to treat it more as lending.

I replaced my [earmuffs](/!/earmuffs/) with ear plugs and gave the
two pairs earmuffs to Matt Senate and Dorothy Howard, respectively.

I had an Aaxa P300 projector (with HDMI cable, and power adapter) that
I had previously found useful but have removed from my bag to keep
things small. And then I gave it to Anabel Church.

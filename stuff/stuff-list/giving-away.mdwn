## Desktop computers
I have two bespoke, artisinal, quiet, hand-crafted-with-love
desktop computers.

One is in an Antec P180 Mini case. It has 16 gigabytes of RAM,
a decent CPU, quiet fans, and several hard drives.
It has lots of room or disk drives and PCI cards.
My father happens to want something like it, so I'm backing up
everything that's on it and am going to tell him how to fix it
up to be what he wants.

One has an Akasa Euler case. It has 16 gigabytes of RAM an SSD,
a decent CPU, and no room for disk drives. It presently has no
wireless network ability, but I have a wireless network card that
might work with it. It has no moving parts, so it's pretty quiet.
[These people](https://twitter.com/thomaslevine/status/439103995894697984)
seem interested in it.

## Other givaways
I have multiple routers and wireless network cards that I'm not using
and lots of books, mainly on statistics, ergonomics, and typography.

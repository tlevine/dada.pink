title: What should I do?
description: What would I like doing other than sleeping?
--------------------------------------------------------

I'm going to tell you some things I have noticed recently and then see if you
have advice for me regarding what I might want to do (for work or whatever).

## I like work that isn't much work
I have been trying to figure out what makes me like work, and all I have come
up with is that I want not to work. That is, I like work when it pays, isn't
much work (part-time, easy application process, not over-time, &c); I usually
say that I like to [sleep](/!/sleeping/).

Saying that I like work that isn't much work simply defers the issue of what
I like to do. I like work that gives me time to do things that I want to do,
but what are those things that I want to do?

## The things I like doing
Most of the things I like to do can be seen as indirect manifestations of my
aversion to work and to other stressful things.

For example, I blew dorm politics [out of proportion](/!/risley-toilets) for
the hilarity; I studied a lot about [open data](/open-data) only to conclude
that it's mostly [hype for hype's sake](/!/searching-data-tables-better)
(and also a bit about [big money](/!/open-data-is-all-about-money/));
I explore the [insanity of buzzwords](/!/buzz-buzz-buzz/);
and my mission to enlighten people to
[musical data analysis](http://fms.csvsoundsystem.com) has
[spiraled](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/sheetmusic)
[out](http://www.corality.com/training/campus/post/august-2014/eusprig-2014-%E2%80%93-financial-modelling-observations)
[of](/!/geom_doner/)
[control](https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/9059/131047).

Some other things can be seen as more direct manifestations of this aversion
to work, such as [this recent (not finished) writing](/!/i-like-people/).

The general pattern I see is that I get bored and frustrated when people take
things seriously and that I react to such things by making them hilarious.

I would rather sleep than get excite about these serious things, and that
brings us back to the original issue: What do I want to do other than nothing?

## Do I want to do something good for the world?
Could it be that I want to do something "good" for the world?
Well maybe, but not in the normal sense.

I [seem](http://www.datakind.org/featuredvolunteers/thomas-levine/)
to like [DataKind](http://datakind.org),
but I'm skeptical that they're saving the world in the way that it sounds like
they are; I mostly just like them because they make me feel
[happy](/!/datakind-is-kind/).

I care something about [open data](/open-data), but only enough that I checked
that it was a waste of time before I decided not to do much about it.

I did quite a bit of work for an
[environmental advocacy group](http://healthygulf.org),
and what I did was apparently quite helpful, but I think it just fuels a silly
quarrel among various players who insist on bureaucratically fighting each
other.

More importantly, I compensate for all of the good I do for the world is with
any of the [horrible things I do for money](/!/curriculum-vitae).

If there is anything that I want to change about the world, it's that I
want people to [sleep](/!/sleeping) more and work less. And this gets us
back to the original issue of what I should do when I'm not sleeping.

## There's something related to teaching
I like kind of like [teaching](/search/?q=tag:learn) people stuff when it
[isn't much work](/!/learning-data-stuff/) and when it seems worthwhile in
a broader sense. For example, the
[command-line workshop](/!/switching-to-command-line/) and these definitions of
"[variable](http://www.datakind.org/blog/multiple-meanings-of-the-word-variable/)",
"[protocol](/!/street-sign-protocol/)", and
"[data table](http://www.datakind.org/blog/whats-in-a-table/)" were kind of fun
because I like to make big words sound less scary.

I'm less excited about the more popular articles on
[parsing PDF files](/!/parsing-pdfs/),
[writing R](/!/r-spells-for-data-wizards/), and on
[getting data out of websites](/!/web-sites-to-data-tables-in-depth/)
because I think they encourage people to learn skills that jobs whose value is
exaggerated.

The bigger message in the definition-type articles is that the words don't mean
that much (and that people are getting overly excited about them). And my
concern with the latter group of articles is that people are getting overly
excited about them. The recurring theme of this article continues: Excitement
is too much work, and I would rather sleep instead.

It is nice to show people that
[they have the power to do things](/!/why-i-like-hackerspaces/),
and this is the first thing I have noticed that gives me some idea of what I
like doing.
Unfortunately, I am reluctant to motivate people to do things when the only
things that I want to do are things that let me do fewer things.

## Or maybe the main thing is people
The things that actually have interested me lately relate rather strongly
to people. For example, computers
[look for people I haven't emailed in a while](http://dada.pink/whom-to-email/README),
[organize some of my personal data](http://dada.pink/dadawarehouse/README),
[remember information about my friends](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cbuh), and
[conduct the repetitive parts of conversations](http://thomaslevine.com/!/geeky-free-software-project/).

How convenient it would be if I could get over my desire to see friends!
I have gotten my computers to do some of the work for me, but it's still hard
to socialize with people because most of them aren't retired. They're doing
serious, important, work-type things most of the time, and that leaves very
little time for the time-consuming and unexciting things that I do for fun,
like napping in the sun, sitting in coffee shops, and taking walks in the park.

## A valiable way of doing nothing
In April 2015 I finally discovered a worthwhile way of doing nothing:
Occupy a beautiful forest that is going to be cut down for stupid reasons,
like for strip mining. I can be helpful in such a context simply by keeping
things in good order and acquiring or preparing food; other people can do
the main activism of interfering with the mining company's plans.

This still doesn't tell me what to do all day, but sitting around in a
activist squat doing nothing sounds a bit more like an answer than sitting
around a normal house doing nothing.

## So what do I do?
It's like I have designed my life such that I don't have to do any unpleasant
work. I have enough money that I can retire, I have little enough
[stuff](/!/stuff/) that I can move easily, and I have even
[transferred my consciousness into a computer](/!/hypermediated-conversation/)
that takes care of the annoying parts of socializing.

People supposedly do sometimes enjoy doing somethings other than nothing,
so I suspect that I would enjoy such things too. Do you have any ideas?

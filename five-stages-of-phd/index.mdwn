title: Five stages of PhD

In my categorical data analysis class (BTRY 6030), 
[Tom DiCiccio](http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/directory/tjd9/)
taught me much more than logistic regression.

On April 20, 2011, we learned about the five stages of PhD. They're

1. Na√Øve optimism
2. Vague anxiety
3. Complete despair
4. I can't believe nobody's done it.
5. God I could have done this in five months.

The third one is the longest, and this is the stage during which students
take up other things to distract them from their schooling. Some people have
lots of kids, for example. Tom took up running and ran something on the order
of miles per day. (I don't remember the figure, but I somehow think it was
between one and ten miles.) Fortunately, he broke his knee or something and
got snapped into the *I can't believe nobody's done this before* stage.

Here's a picture of my notes from that day.

## Jobs
I am just about done with traveling and am thus available for
full-time work. I'm still available for consulting. In either case,
this is what I'm looking for in a job.

### Mission

I want to do good work, get paid for it, and either have time to sleep
or make enough money that I can retire. I see work neither as an
exciting challenge nor as a social mission, but I am happy to put on an
act for your HR department.

### Salary

In most countries, I would be happy with a competitive salary. My gauge
of United States salaries is especially precise; for full-time positions
in the United States, $120,000 is the minimum salary that I consider.
Lower salaries are perfectly fine for part-time positions or for
positions in Europe.

I don't have a strict cut-off for consulting projects, as it depends on
the nature of the project and the manner of billing.

I will consider barter for small projects. The easiest thing to trade me
is probably a room in your vacation house or on your farm for a week.

### Location

I prefer cities/towns that are quiet, vaguely topographically flat,
and climaticly temperate or cold. Only a few large cities are
unpleasantly loud for me, such as London and New York. Stockholm and
Belgrade, while hilly, are still flat enough; Seattle and Pristina,
for example, are a bit too hilly. I should be fine with the climate
if it's not a desert or if there's air conditioning.

I am also quite happy to do remote work or to travel.

That said, compared to the non-mission and salary, the location is
much less important to me.

## Application process
If you are interested in having me work for you, please send me an
email that addresses the following questions.

1. What does the work entail, briefly?
2. Why do you want *me* to work for you?
3. What would you like to pay me?
4. If you have a formal interview process, what is it?

I'll try respond quickly with whether I would like to proceed.

## Creating a remote git repository
Create a public remote git repository like so.

    mkdir new-project
    cd new-project
    git init
    publicgit

That creates remotes at
[dada.pink](http://dada.pink)
and [GitHub](https://github.com/tlevine) and sets them
as origin.

Create a private remote git repository like so.

    mkdir new-project
    cd new-project
    git init
    privategit

That creates a remote at [safe](/operations/) and sets
it as the origin.

(These functions are provided in the
[profile](https://github.com/tlevine/profile).)

## Switch keyboard layouts
Type `aoeu` to switch to QWERTY, and
type `asdf` to switch to Dvorak.

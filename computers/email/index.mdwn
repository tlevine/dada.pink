How my email system works....

* gandi
  * forwarding
* imapfilter
* offlineimap
* mutt
  * aliases

what else....

## Mailboxes
Emails arrive in the Inbox mailbox. Imapfilter moves most of them to
one of the following mailbox.

* Lists (mailing lists)
* Pulse (emails that I don't read but haven't figured out how to
    disable, such as most things from Facebook, GitHub and LinkedIn)
* Spam

I read the emails that remain in Inbox.
After I read the email, I preferably do something right away that allows
me to never read the email again. If the email is just a newsletter,
I don't have to do anything else. More likely, I wind up adding something
to my calendar/to-do-list or responding to the email. Once I have fully
addressed the email, I move it to one of these places

* Archive (most emails)
* Interesting (particularly interesting emails)

If I want to do something about the email but keep not doing anything
about it, I move it to the "Catharsis" mailbox. This makes it easier to
look through the remaining things in Inbox.

I read the emails in Lists and Catharsis when I'm bored.

## Forwarding
Pretty much any email address you might have for me forwards to
[\_@thomaslevine.com](mailto:_@thomaslevine.com).

## Permissions
By default, I consider all emails I receive to contain private information.
Within my [data classification scheme](../permissions/), I consider emails
to be "home" level data.

I can selectively decide to publish emails by moving them from to the "Public"
mailbox. These emails get sent to the computer running the Dada Portal software,
which indexes them for searching exposes them in the email endpoint.

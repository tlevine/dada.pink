# What is data, and what is a data scientist?
Data science is a very new field that we are still figuring out how to
talk about. As such, it has taken a little while for us to make sense of
all of the. Having worked in data science for a few years, I finally think
I have a good understanding of the field, and I present for you my definitions
of the following terms

* data
* big data
* data science
* data scientist
* software engineer (in the context of data science)
* data engineer

## The field of data


## Roles

### Data scientists
Data scientists are people who want to feel like they are conducting
novel research (by their own definitions of "research"), were unable
to get jobs in academia, and managed to find work in the field of data.
The specific work that they do is quite varied, but it usually gets
packaged as the creation of new knowledge, rather than as the creation
of new software.

### Software engineers
Software engineers are people who work in data but did not previously
consider work in academia or do not feel the need to conduct novel
research.

### Data engineers
An additional *data engineer* role is sometimes present. It describes
someone that is between a software engineer and a data scientist.

A data engineer is usually the same as a software engineer, but with
different branding. The name "software engineer" alludes to a time before
the recent interest in data, and the name "data engineer" alludes to recent
times. Data engineers are often younger than software engineers and tend to
conduct themselves less conservatively than data engineers. Software
engineers bring wisdom from a earlier times, and data engineers bring
youthful creativity and aspirations.

Data engineer are sometimes more like data scientists, however.
This is most likely to happen if the data scientist had previously
aspired to work in
computer science, or another field with "computer" in the name. If the
person previously sought out academic work in ecology, for example,
he or she is most likely to be considered a data scientist.

If a company has both software engineers and data engineers, then the
data engineers usually develop tools for data scientists or data analysts,
based on data generated by the core product, and the software engineers
focus on developing the core product.

# What is data, and what is a data scientist?
Data science is a very new field that we are still figuring out how to
talk about. As such, it has taken a little while for us to make sense of
all of the. Having worked in data science for a few years, I finally think
I have a good understanding of the field, and I present for you my definitions
of the following terms

* data
* big data
* data science
* data scientist
* data visualization developer
* data visualization engineer
* software engineer (in the context of data science)
* data engineer

## The field of data
As computation and digital storage gets cheaper, we can more whimsically put
insane amounts of computing power towards studies of how the world works.
The various practices of the contemporary data field stem from this happening.

"Big data", "data science", and plain "data" all refer to the practice of
putting using this insane degree of computing power to study stuff. These terms
in fact mean different things to different people, but they consistently allude
to this recent perspective on research that stems from a decrease in the cost
of computers.

The various practices/values within the data field all follow naturally from
this defining feature. I discuss some of these practices/values below.

### Store everything
Storage is cheap, so aim to store everything that is easy to collect.
In data science, we instinctively store data in the most raw form that is
convenient, and don't worry very much about how or even whether we're going
to analyze it. One of the aspects of data science is the collection and
management of huge quantitaties of data, before we even consider really
looking at it.

### Anything can be quantified
Everything can be turned into a number, and computers can compute numbers
much more cheaply than humans can. In data science, we look
for numbers in everything, because we need to turn stuff into numbers in
order for our computers to process them.

### Repetitive tasks should be automated
Data science is all about replacing expensive human thought with inexpensive
computers. In data science, we make the following sorts of decisions.

* Data collection should be automatic and unobtrusive; questionnaires and lab
    studies are too much work.
* Collect any data that might be useful later or that are just easy to collect.
    Don't wait until you have a full-fleged research plan.
* All analyses should be scripted.

### Focus on connecting datasets rather than on tuning models
In a conventional statistics class, you'll learn a lot about how to choose
analysis methods that are appropriate for your data collection approach and how
to tune the models for a specific dataset. That way of thinking is not new.

Here's the new thing. Now that we have hoards of inexpensive data, it's not
worth worrying so much about making the best use out of one dataset; it's better
to use a range of datasets, and especially to connect one dataset to lots of
other datasets. To use machine learning speak, you should focus more on collecting
features rather than on tuning your model.

## Rhetoric
Two defining components of data science are quantitative abilities and
an interest or ability to do research. Before we discuss the different
sorts of people who work in data science, we need to discuss these key
skills.

### Research
We often talk about "research" in data science. The meaning of "research"
in this context is very similar to academic research. The definitions I found
in the "[research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research)" article on
Wikipedia seem pretty good.

> Research comprises "creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order
> to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of humans, culture
> and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new
> applications."

In data science, research is implicitly *scientific* research.

> Scientific research is a systematic way of gathering data and harnessing
> curiosity. This research provides scientific information and theories for the
> explanation of the nature and the properties of the world. It makes practical
> applications possible.

### Quanitative abilities
Data science is big on quantitative skills, and people who work in data science
are classified based on their quantitative skills.
A person is considered to have strong quantitative skills if most he or she
meets most of the following criteria.

* He is male, or she conducts herself very masculinely.
* She believes that her work is very sophisticated or complicated.
* He or she presents her work in ways that are difficult for most
  people to understand.

## People in data
Now that I have discussed the general field of data, I can tell you
about the different sorts of people that we find within the field.

### Data scientists
The main personification of the field of data science is the data scientist.

Data scientists are people who want to feel like they are conducting
novel research, were unable
to get jobs in academia, managed to find work in the field of data,
and are considered to possess strong quantitative skills.

The specific work that they do is quite varied, but it usually gets
packaged as the creation of new knowledge, rather than as the creation
of new software.

### Data visualization developer
A data visualization developer is person who meets all of the
above criteria for being a data scientist except that he or she is
thought to lack the quantitative skills necessary for data scientist. That is,

* He or she is female.
* He or she presents her work in ways that broad audiences can understand it.
* He or she is less concerned about the sophistication/complexity of her work
  than a data scientist would be.

A data visualization developer packages his or her work as novel research,
just like a data scientist, but the work usually gets distributed to a wide
and distant audience. For example, while a data scientist would report his
findings to a small committee within a company, a data visualization developer
would report her findings to the public at large.

### Software engineers
Software engineers are people who work in data and have strong quantitative
skills but did not previously consider work in academia or do not feel the
need to conduct novel research.

### Data engineers
An additional *data engineer* role is sometimes present. It describes
someone that is between a software engineer and a data scientist.

A data engineer is usually the same as a software engineer, but with
different branding. The name "software engineer" alludes to a time before
the recent interest in data, and the name "data engineer" alludes to recent
times. Data engineers are often younger than software engineers and tend to
conduct themselves less conservatively than data engineers. Software
engineers bring wisdom from a earlier times, and data engineers bring
youthful creativity and aspirations.

Data engineers are sometimes more like data scientists, however.
This is most likely to happen if the data scientist had previously
aspired to work in
computer science, or another field with "computer" in the name. If the
person previously sought out academic work in ecology, for example,
he or she is most likely to be considered a data scientist; if the
person previously sought out academic work in computer science, however,
there is a chance that he or she would be considered a data engineer.

If a company has both software engineers and data engineers, then the
data engineers usually develop tools for data scientists or data analysts,
and the software engineers focus on developing the core product.

### Data visualization engineer
A data visualization engineer is person who meets all of the
criteria for being a software/data engineer except that he or she is
thought to lack the quantitative skills necessary for data scientist.
In contrast to the software/data engineer,

* His work is intended to be viewed by a larger audience. If the company
  produces a software product, data scientists might work more on business
  analysis, and data engineers might work more on product features that
  customers use.
* He or she is more likely to be female, though he is probably still male.
* He or she is less concerned about the sophistication/complexity of her work
  than a data scientist would be.

## The future
The trend towards more data will continue, and the field of data will
thus be around in some form for a reasonably long time. The people in this
field, on the other hand, may change somewhat as data science becomes
established as a formal academic discipline. People who work as data
scientists really want to work as academic researchers. When data science
becomes a formal academic discipline and data scientists finally find
jobs as academics, we might have to come up with a new name for the people
who want to be academics but can't find work.

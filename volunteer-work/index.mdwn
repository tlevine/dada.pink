# Volunteer work
People talk of
[volunteer](http://okfn.org)
[open](http://openaddresses.io/)
[openness](http://www.codeforamerica.org/)
[work](https://www.wikipedia.org/)
being bad because of the exploitation, overrepresentation of
overrepresented people, bad results, lack of funding for things
that should be funded, alignment towards interests of rich
people, and any number of other things.

Surely this stuff has happened before!

I get the impression that this volunteer stuff is eventually done in a
more formal way, through things like
[Médecins Sans Frontières](http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org),
[Peace Corps](http://www.peacecorps.gov),
[Teach for America](http://www.teachforamerica.org/), and
[World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms (WWOOF)](http://www.wwoof.net/).
Lots of nominally for-profit jobs expect workers to make substantial
unpaid sacrifices, like
[teaching](http://gawker.com/why-teachers-pay-for-students-supplies-out-of-their-own-1669305507).

Perhaps you see this volunteer work as exploitation or as a pyramid scheme.
That's also a common pattern in pretty much every industry I have ever heard of.

Since I see the same unpleasant sort of volunteer-type things happening
absolutely everywhere else, I find it only natural that these things should
happen in the industry of openly open openness.

And this is why I prefer to [sleep](/!/sleeping/).

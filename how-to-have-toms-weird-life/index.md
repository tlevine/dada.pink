I commented to several friends that

My life appeals to at least one person.

> Thomas, I need your life. Can we trade? wink emoticon

It turns out that I'm contemplating trading with that person, but I think
it's easier for now to copy rather than trade. Here is how you can have
my life.

1. Reduce your stuff to a [package that you don't mind carrying it all the
    time](https://thomaslevine.com/!/stuff/). This could be a lot more stuff
    than you realize, depending on how you carry it. I usually recommend
    against [bicycle](https://thomaslevine.com/!/cycling/).
2. Stop finding life purpose in your
    [job](https://thomaslevine.com/!/career-advice/), or at least find purpose
    in something else. (I dunno how to do the latter.)
3. Get a fancy handheld GPS thingy, and put OpenStreetMap on it.
4. Say yes when people offer to introduce you to people, and visit people if
    they tell you to visit them.
5. Consider what worldwide social groups you associate with. Religions,
    legit social groups, or specialized interests should all work.
    I've found [hackerspaces](http://hackerspaces.org/) to work quite well.
    Other things that I think would work are churches, belly dancing societies,
    and the Great Backyard Bird Count. You have to participate in these for a
    little while before you can start meeting people through them.
6. Go to pretty much any town/city that is small enough that people don't
    understand why you went there.

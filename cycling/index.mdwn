I recently got a bike! It's a 2010 Surly Long Haul Trucker.
And then I got assorted fancy bike toys. And I am likely to get rid
of all of this soon.

## Original interest in bicycles
I hadn't previously been into bikes and hadn't had a bike in 15 years,
but I got excited about bikes on Sunday, November 30, 2014.
While standing at a look-out place looking out over some pretty water
in Seattle, I got into a conversation with a person who was also there
and also with a bike. He said that highway 101 is a great place to bike
long distances and that there's camping along the way. This sounds fun.
I want to see pretty places and go camping without a car.

Moreover, I want to go to many places in the United States, and most of
them are practically inaccessible public transit, which is usually
unpleasant in other ways too. I had been thinking about whether I should
finally get a driver's license, but cycling seemed easier once I realized
I could cycle between cities. I previously hadn't realized that you could
ride your bicycle when moving house, rather than carrying it.

## Toys
I started looking at all sorts of cycling things on the internet and
compiled a [bunch of links](internet). I determined that I should get an
American bike because they're cheapest and that I should get a Surly
Long Haul Trucker, specifically. And then I checked Craigslist and
happened to find a good deal on one of those that fit me pretty well.
Woo!

Here are some [things I was thinking about getting](want) and have mostly
gotten. And here are some extended [notes on the wanting](want-notes).

## Remarks about cycling after getting a bicycle
Not having cycled much before, I had a lot to learn about bicycles.
Here are some things that were not obvious to me before.

### Some people actually like cycling
When people talk about "cycle touring", I think the emphasis is on the
"cycle" rather than the "touring". I saw a bicycle as a more convenient
mode of transit than airplane and long-distance train and was not so
concerned with the main act of pedaling and steering.

### Cycling isn't exhausting
People keep telling me that cycling long distances is hard physically
on the body. I never understood this, and I still don't.

Let me say that more precisely. If I walk with only a few things in my bag
and take breaks periodically, I will be unpleasantly tired after three hours.
On the other hand, I can cycle all day with 40 pounds of baggage (still with
periodic breaks). I'll be tired at the end, but it won't be as bad as three
hours of walking. And I'll also have travelled much further.

### Carrying a bicycle is exhausting
It took me a while to decide on getting a bicycle because I didn't want to carry
the bicycle. Then I somehow convinced myself that it I could ride a bicycle
instead of carrying it and that it would be pretty easy to take a bicycle on
a train or airplane. Also, I thought it would be easier to carry stuff because
it would be in pannier bags on racks rather than on my back.

I somehow hadn't read about the hassle associated with carrying a bicycle.
I'll say more about this later, but let's say for now that carrying my bicycle
for a few minutes in a train station is way more exhausting than riding it for
a few hours on a road. I suppose my bicycle is designed more for the latter
than for the former.

### Carrying a bicycle is also expensive
A bicycle appealed to me because I thought it would make it easier to get out
of cities. One one hand, I have been able to go to places that weren't cities.
On the other hand, I could have done this more cheaply by taking trains and taxis.
Consider how much I spent just to have my bicycle with me for the past three weeks.

* $59 to check the bicycle on the airplane
* $59 to check all my other stuff, which wouldn't fit on carry-on because of
    all the bike tools
* About $400 of repairs for stuff that got damaged on the flight
* More money if I decide to take the bicycle

(This excludes the purchase cost of the bicycle and small things like bicycle
tickets on trains.)

I might have saved $150 by putting the bicycle in a hard case. The case would
have cost about $200, and I would have had to take a taxi or something to the
airport.

Anyway, instead of paying $500 or $600 to have the bicycle for three weeks,
I could have taken expensive taxis and trains every week.

### On the Netherlands being good for cycling
People often remark that the Netherlands has
[outstanding cycling infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_in_the_Netherlands).
This remark ignores that the Netherlands has good transportation infrastructure
in general.

The Dutch have higher standards for quality of life than I am used to.
An American might say that they are "spoiled". For example, to the Dutch,
20 minutes is a long tram ride, and 1 hour is a ridiculous car ride.
(Their trams and cars also move more slowly than I am used to, by the way.)
The mother of one Dutch friend was distraught upon learning that her daughter
was going to move 20 kilometers away from home for school.

In the United States, one might classify such talk as whining and then ignore
the talk. Not in the Netherlands! There, if you complain to the appropriate
person, that person will actually do something about it!

### OpenStreetMap and GPS is really awesome

I recently got a bike! It's a 2010 Surly Long Haul Trucker.
I got it in Seattle in December 2014.
And then I got assorted fancy bike toys.

And then I left it in DÃ¼sseldorf in April 2015.

## Original interest in bicycles
I hadn't previously been into bikes and hadn't had a bike in 15 years,
but I got excited about bikes on Sunday, November 30, 2014.
While standing at a look-out place looking out over some pretty water
in Seattle, I got into a conversation with a person who was also there
and also with a bike. He said that highway 101 is a great place to bike
long distances and that there's camping along the way. This sounds fun.
I want to see pretty places and go camping without a car.

Moreover, I want to go to many places in the United States, and most of
them are practically inaccessible public transit, which is usually
unpleasant in other ways too. I had been thinking about whether I should
finally get a driver's license, but cycling seemed easier once I realized
I could cycle between cities. I previously hadn't realized that you could
ride your bicycle when moving house, rather than carrying it.

## Considering what type of bicycle to get
I started looking at all sorts of cycling things on the internet and
compiled a [bunch of links](internet/). I determined that I should get an
American bike because they're cheapest and that I should get a Surly
Long Haul Trucker, specifically. And then I checked Craigslist and
happened to find a good deal on one of those that fit me pretty well.
Woo!

Here are some [things I was thinking about getting](want/) and have mostly
gotten. And here are some extended [notes on the wanting](want-notes/).

## Remarks about cycling after getting a bicycle
Not having cycled much before, I had a lot to learn about bicycles.
Here are some things that were not obvious to me before.

### Some people actually like cycling
When people talk about "cycle touring", I think the emphasis is on the
"cycle" rather than the "touring". I saw a bicycle as a more convenient
mode of transit than airplane and long-distance train and was not so
concerned with the main act of pedaling and steering.

### Cycling isn't exhausting
People keep telling me that cycling long distances is hard physically
on the body. I never understood this, and I still don't.

Let me say that more precisely. If I walk with only a few things in my bag
and take breaks periodically, I will be unpleasantly tired after three hours.
On the other hand, I can cycle all day with 40 pounds of baggage (still with
periodic breaks). I'll be tired at the end, but it won't be as bad as three
hours of walking. And I'll also have travelled much further.

### Carrying a bicycle is exhausting
It took me a while to decide on getting a bicycle because I didn't want to carry
the bicycle. Then I somehow convinced myself that it I could ride a bicycle
instead of carrying it and that it would be pretty easy to take a bicycle on
a train or airplane. Also, I thought it would be easier to carry stuff because
it would be in pannier bags on racks rather than on my back.

I somehow hadn't read about the hassle associated with carrying a bicycle.
I'll say more about this later, but let's say for now that carrying my bicycle
for a few minutes in a train station is way more exhausting than riding it for
a few hours on a road. I suppose my bicycle is designed more for the latter
than for the former.

Aside from the exhaustion from picking up the bicycle and walking up stairs,
there is also the exhaustion of figuring out how to take the bicycle on a
train. Different carriers have different policies, and very rarely are any
of the policies clear.

### Carrying a bicycle is also expensive
A bicycle appealed to me because I thought it would make it easier to get out
of cities. One one hand, I have been able to go to places that weren't cities.
On the other hand, I could have done this more cheaply by taking trains and taxis.
Consider how much I spent just to have my bicycle with me for the past three weeks.

* $59 to check the bicycle on the airplane
* $59 to check all my other stuff, which wouldn't fit on carry-on because of
    all the bike tools
* About $300 of repairs for stuff that got damaged on the flight
* More money if I decide to take the bicycle back to where I came from

(This excludes the purchase cost of the bicycle and small things like bicycle
tickets on trains.)

I might have saved $50 by putting the bicycle in a fancy hard case; the case
would have cost about $200, and I would have had to take a taxi or something
to the airport. This assumes, of course, that the hard case would have protected
the bicycle, and I don't particularly think that it would have. And I would have
had to assemble and disassemble the bicycle, which would take a while.

Anyway, instead of paying about $500 to have the bicycle for three weeks,
I could have taken expensive taxis and trains every week.

### Tools and supplies are big
It had not occurred to me how much stuff I would need for cycling. Aside from
the bike itself (which is quite big, by the way), I also need to carry locks,
tools, and supplies like oil. These extra things approximately double the volume
and triple the mass of all of my stuff.

And that's ignoring all of the extra bags and the rack that I need to carry all
of this in! Those aren't that heavy, but they are quite voluminous.

### On the Netherlands being good for cycling
People often remark that the Netherlands has
[outstanding cycling infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_in_the_Netherlands).
This remark ignores that the Netherlands has good transportation infrastructure
in general.

The Dutch have higher standards for quality of life than I am used to.
An American might say that they are "spoiled". For example, to the Dutch,
20 minutes is a long tram ride, and 1 hour is a ridiculous car ride.
(Their trams and cars also move more slowly than I am used to, by the way.)
The mother of one Dutch friend was distraught upon learning that her daughter
was going to move 20 kilometers away from home for school.

In the United States, one might classify such talk as whining and then ignore
the talk. Not in the Netherlands! There, if you complain to the appropriate
person, that person will actually do something about it!

### The right way to lock bicycles
I read that the right way to lock bicycles is to put a U-lock around
the back wheel and a cable around the front wheel and frame. And both
locks go around a pole or bick rack or something. For quick stops
where you don't want to spend a long time locking and unlocking the
bike, you put a cable lock around the frame and a pole.

These methods are very slow. I quite liked what I saw in the
Netherlands; pretty much everybody has a lock around the back wheel,
locking it to the frame, and a chain wrapped around the seatpost.
For quick stops, you just turn the key to lock the back wheel.
For longer stops, you chain the frame to something. With a chain
rather than a U lock, it's easier to find an appropriate place to
lock the bike to.

### OpenStreetMap and GPS is really awesome
The best thing I learned from cycling was that OpenStreetMap and GPS-based
navigation thingies are really really awesome. I had never found OpenStreetMap
to be that helpful when I used it on the website or on OSMAnd, but it was
when I used it on the small GPS thingy I got (Garmin etrex 30). Also, it's
way more fast and detailed and correct than any Google or Bing maps.

Also, the GPS thingy is smaller than a smartphone, and the battery lasts longer.

I don't particularly recommend this GPS thingy, as I didn't look very hard;
I just went into an outdoors store (Bever) and chose from what they had there.

## What bicycle I would get knowing what I know now
I chose my present bicycle by reading on the internet about what other people
use for touring and then getting very standard stuff.

<h3 id="good-infrastructure">Bicycles are nearly pointless in western Europe</h3>
I completely don't see the point of cycling between the cities that I have
been cycling through (Netherlands and western Germany). Everything is so
well connected that I could just *walk* (not public transit, just walking)
between cities and still easily find a real bed to sleep on each night.

It's also so well connected that I could take local public transit
between cities. Or long-distance trains.

### For places with good infrastructure
As I indicate above, bicycles are nearly pointless in places that are well
connected. But I did say "nearly" rather than "completely". I liked being
able to cycle from one part of a city to another as I could do this faster
than walking and without carrying stuff on my back. But I didn't do this
very often as it was quite inconvenient to prepare for this.

Here are the extra things that I would do surrounding such a trip.

* Add and remove bags from bicycle
* Lock and unlock the bicycle
* Find a place to park the bicycle

I think a bicycle, or something like it, could be convenient in places
like this if the above difficulties could be removed.
I think I could do this by having a bicycle that either is very
cheap or that can quickly be made small enough to carry in a backpack.

#### Cheap
A bicycle that is very cheap is nice because I wouln't need as good of
a lock or as many locks. Also, if it's a generally bad bicycle, I wouldn't
care so much about keeping it in good shape, so I would be fine with not
owning tools. Also, I wouldn't need to take it on airplanes as I could just
buy a new one every time I go to a new place. On the other hand, buying stuff
so often is a lot of work, and I would rather avoid that.

#### Compact
The other option is a bicycle that is so compact as to make it easy to carry.
If it is so easy to carry, then locks are not necessary, as I can just take
the bicycle with me rather than locking it. Also, I wouldn't need to carry
tools, as I wouldn't need to disassemble it for transport, and I could just
carry it to the nearest bike shop if it ever broke in some way (most likely
a flat tire).

Unfortunately, most folding bicycles are still too big to check on airplanes
and trains as ordinary luggage. (They might not cost extra, but they're big
enough that you need to check the policies.) Also, they are quite expensive,
so it might be cheaper to take lots of taxis.

These are small and neat but still too big, I think.

I hear also that they're not good for long distances. But I heard that
cycling long distances was hard in general. The latter commend is wrong,
so maybe the former comment is wrong too.

Also, I might consider something other than a bicycle, such as a scooter,
longboard, or freeline skates.

### For places with bad infrastructure
I had originally been thinking about using the bicycle in the United States.
Maybe it would have made sense there, or in another developing country.
However, I don't see the reason for getting a road bike in places like this.

Aside from major highways, which are usually in good shape, road quality
is quite unpredictable in the United States. Also, decent bike paths are
uncommon. This is to say that I would recommend against a road bike.

Also, as you'll read [below](#camping), I don't think camping will make the
trip any easier, so I would be fine with a bike that doesn't have much storage
space.

For long-distance travel in the United States, I would get some
sort of mountain bike. Ideally, I would manage to fit all of my stuff
in a frame bag, (See Jandd for examples.) but I likely would wind up
with a front rack instead.

<h3 id="camping">If I really really really need to camp</h3>
The only reason I see to have a touring bike is so I can carry a lot of
stuff, and the only reason I see to do this is if I plan on camping.
My bike is quite prefect for such a ride. However, I find it rather
unlikely that I would ever need to take such a ride.

I had figured that being able to camp would make travel more convenient,
as I would have more flexibility as to where I sleep. I no longer think
that is the case.

As I mentioned [above](#good-infrastructure), the Netherlands and Germany
are so well connected that you don't need to camp.

The United States
isn't so well connected, but camping legally seemed difficult when I checked.
Or at least it involved a lot of planning.
Most people I know who ride bicycles can only do it because they're fine with
breaking the law&mdash;cycling in the wrong direction, running red lights,
and not signaling, for example. If you have such disrespect for the law while
on your bicycle, I suppose you're probably fine with trespassing in order to
camp when you get off your bicycle.

If I want to camp in the same site for several weeks, a bike might be nice,
but a big backpack might be easier. You wouldn't be able to fit as much stuff
in it,
(Everything on my bike would fit in a big backpack, but I'm not using most
of the space on the bike.)
but it would mean for less hassle on public transit. Also, as I keep
mentioning, you could take a taxi for a fraction of the cost of a bicycle.

So, if you need to camp, first consider really hard whether you need to,
and then get a touring bike if you really really really need to camp.

### If you don't use it very often
I think a bicycle would be more convenient if I used it only infrequently
and stored it in a consistent place when I wasn't using it. This way, I could
use it only when I thought it would be helpful and not when I thought it would
get in the way of things.

But then I'd need to find a place to store it. Moreover, what's the point of
having one if you don't use it very often? For the price of a bicycle, you
could just take lots of taxis instead.

### I probably won't get another bicycle soon
All of the above bicycle options still seem like far too much hassle
compared to walking, so I'll probably stick with that for now.

To get between cities in Europe, I can easily walk and stay in hostels every
night. Or use couchsurfing, which I still haven't ever done. The United States
would need more planning and would probably require couchsurfing. And in either
case, I can easily get on a train if I need to be somewhere quickly.

## Relevance of my preferences to other people
Your preferences regarding bicycles might not match mine. In particular,
other people seem to be much better at carrying stuff.
For example, lots of people are okay with maintaining a car.
If you already manage to maintain a car, a bicycle should be a piece of cake.

# On balancing checkbooks

Balancing checkbooks is one of those things that people say everyone should
know how to do. It's also one of those should learn in school or whatnot. I
jokingly and arrogantly don't see why.

## What I do
I had never learned to balance a checkbook, so when I wanted to account
better for movements of money,
I looked for accounting software on Source Forge and found that
GnuCash had many downloads, recommendations, &c. Then I installed it and spent
a Sunday afternoon skimming the
[GnuCash tutorial](http://gnucash.org/docs/v2.4/C/gnucash-guide/index.html).
This has been enough to satisfy me since.

## Why not checkbooks
This leads me to find it silly to learn/teach checkbook-balancing. First,
imputing data on paper is
silly these days because computers can transcribe things much more easily and
reliably than people can. Second, as far as I can tell, the "balancing" a
checkbook thing is just a buzzy word for reconciling, so it's not really a big
deal. Third, checkbooks seem quite limited. Again, I've never properly learned,
but here are a bunch of things that seem annoying to do in a checkbook:

* Split transactions
* Double-entry accounting
* Drawing graphs
* Multiple accounts

## Don't learn checkbooks
In conclusion, I see no reason to teach people to balance their checkbooks;
just use some proper computer-based accounting system.

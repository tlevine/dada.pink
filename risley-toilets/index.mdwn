Some concerns over sanitation of bathrooms in
[my dorm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risley_Residential_College) in the
2010--11 school year. Rather than unproductively join the circular argument
that my dormmates were having, I looked around and talked to people.

I first interviewed some residents and observed the bathrooms in order to
identify components of the concept of bathroom sanitation. I then performed
more structured observations sent questionnaires to residents. I also reviewed
emails related to bathroom sanitation.

Findings suggest that urine on toilets is the most important issue to residents
and that room trash in bathrooms is important to Facilities Management but not
to residents. Bathrooms seemed dirtier in more public or more frequently used
hallways within the building, such as the main hallways and the lower floors.
Also, sex of the residents of a hallway seems related to whether urine and hair
show up on toilet seats.

The identification of environmental factors influencing bathroom sanitation
might be useful residents who are selecting a room in Risley for the coming
year. Well that's obvious. More interestingly, the variation in sanitation
across bathrooms may partially explain why people disagreed about the
conditions of the bathrooms.

More importantly, I proposed some novel strategies for maintaining cleanliness;
before reading the [resulting paper](risley_toilets.pdf), my dormmates' only
approach was to yell at each other.

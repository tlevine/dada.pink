----------

There are a lot of acronyms on the internet that end in "P",
like TCP, IP, and HTTP. This "P" stands for "protocol".
Perhaps you are wondering what a protocol is.

"Protocol" is one of those words that sounds more special than it really is.
The concept of a computer protocol might sound quite complex, but
it's a rather generic concept; it's something like a language,
an expectation, and a social norm.

The way a particular protocol works might be quite complicated, but
I just want to explain the generic concept of a protocol. I'm going
to do this by writing about a protocol that you might not think of
as a protocol.

## The street sign protocol 
I'm going to document a protocol that we might not usually think of a
protocol. Let's call it the Street Sign Protocol (SSP).

To keep things simple, I'll actually document a simple version of the
Street Sign Protocol. Let's call it the Simple Street Sign Protocol (SSSP).

### Why we might want SSSP
You might already be familiar with how street signs work, but it took you a while
to figure it out. Also, you are probably so familiar with street signs that you
don't really think about all of the small details that are involved in communication
through street signs.

If we wanted to tell a robot how to communicate through street signs, it would be
helpful to be very explicit and precise about all of the aspects of street signs.

### Specification
SSSP is a way of exchanging the names of *streets*. It involves
*street signs* mounted on *poles* near the *corners* of
*four-way intersections*. Let's define these terms.

* A *street* is a paved public thoroughfare in a built environment.
    (This definition is taken from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street).)
* A *four-way intersection* is a place where two streets cross.
    Its shape is approximately a rectangle, with one side having the
    width of one street and the other side having the width of the
    other street.
* Being rectangular, a four-way intersection has four *corners* at the
    usual places.
* A *pole* is a long cylinder sticking out of the ground.
* A *street sign* is a flat rectangular thing that has text on both faces.
    The sign is oriented such that the text reads left-to-right.

Now we can define the SSSP in outrageous precision and verbosity! *You'll probably
get confused as you read the paragraphs below, so keep in mind that this is just
a very precise and verbose explanation of what we usually consider to be street signs*.

Each four-way intersection has four corners, and each pole is associated with
a corner of an intersection. Each corner must have zero or one poles, and at least
one of the corners of a four-way intersection must have a pole; thus, an
intersection must have between one and four poles.

Poles must be mounted within about ten feet of a corner of the intersection
but not on the paved area of the street or the intersection. (It is okay for them
to be mounted on the sidewalk.) Each pole must stick straight out of the ground; the long
axis of the cylinder must be approximately in line with the direction of gravity.

Each street sign displays the name of one street. The street sign must include the
name of the street in very large text. This name must be written on both faces of
the sign and must be especially easy to see, even at night.

Street signs are mounted on poles, each pole having exactly two street signs.
The street signs must be aligned in a particular way. One of the faces must be
just-barely-touching (tangent) the pole. The sign must also line up with its
corresponding street; that is, the wide axis of the rectangular sign must run
parallel the corresponding street.

Each pole must contain two street signs, each one corresponding to a different
one of the two streets at the four-way intersection.

### Implementing a SSSP writer
Here is one possible procedure for encoding street names in SSSP. This procedure
expects a four-way intersection and the names of the two streets as input. It
outputs SSSP (two street signs mounted to a pole near the intersection).

1. Determine which corner(s) of the intersections the street signs should be
    mounted on. You might consider the locations of buildings, the presence
    of sidewalks, the traffic patterns and the presence of visual obstacles
    like trees.
2. Print the signs with the street names.
3. Fabricate a pole.
4. Put a pole and street signs on a truck.
5. Drive the truck to the intersection, and park nearby.
6. Carry the materials and some tools to the intersection.
7. Stick the pole in the ground near the chosen corner. I imagine that this
    involves putting up caution tape, digging a hole, securing the pole, pouring
    some concrete and covering it back up, but I don't really know. If this were
    software, I'd try to use separate pole-installation library so I don't have
    to implement the pole-installation procedure myself.
8. Mount the street signs to the pole. Position them about ten feet above the ground,
    with one on top of the other and with the centers of the signs touching the pole,
    and otherwise in the appropriate orientations specified by the protocol. Secure
    them with a sign bracket.
9. Drive the truck back to wherever you got it from.

### Implementing a SSSP reader
Here is a procedure for decoding SSSP. It has the opposite inputs and outputs as
the SSSP writer.

1. Look for poles with street signs at the four corners of the four-way intersection.
2. Focus on the first valid pole that you see; ignore any others.
3. Do the following for each of the two street signs.
  1. Read the large text on the sign.
  2. Associate this large text with the street that the sign lines up with.

## Hypertext Transfer Protocol
Now let's talk about something that people actually call a protocol.
Here's a simplified version of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

### Why we use HTTP
When you look at stuff on the internet with a web browser, your web browser and
various web servers are sending messages between each other. HTTP is a common
language that all of these computers use.

While all of these web servers are expecting HTTP, you can actually send them
anything you want. If it is sort of like HTTP but with a few typos, the web
server might figure out what you meant. But if you sent random garbage, the
web server would not have any idea of what you wanted.

We have common internet languages for the same reasons that we have common
human languages. If you talk to me in English, I'll understand you quite well.
I'll make sense of it even you you are not using Queen's English. But I won't
really have any idea what you mean if you use sign language.

We agree to use HTTP on all of these different computers because it makes it
easier for the computers to understand each other.

### Highly simplified specification
HTTP is a way of exchanging information between a web browser and a web server.
It involves *messages*, which are very long series of words, punctuation and
spaces. HTTP prescribes who sends and receives these messages and how these
messages are formatted.

Some messages have a *body*. This is an embedded series of words, punctuation
and spaces that can be written in any format you want.

Each message may have a bunch of *headers*. Each header has a name and a value.
There are a bunch of headers that provide some information about the body
(like its size or format), and there are a bunch of headers that provide
information about the system that is sending the message. And there are others,
like the date of the message.

Each message is either a request or a response. By being a request, a message
indicates that it came from a web browser and is being sent to a web server.
By being a response, a message indicates that it came from a web server and
is being sent to a web browser. Each response sent from a particular server
to a particular browser must be initiated by a request sent from the
particular browser to particular server.

Every response has a body (explained above) and a status code. The status code
is a number that explains whether the request succeeded and any quirks about its
success or failure. For example, status code `200` means that the request worked
as expected, and status code `403` means that you don't have permission to do
whatever you tried to do.

Each request must have a method. There are a bunch of methods, and you can think
of them as different commands. Here are a few of them.

* `POST` is the method that asks the server to save a new document.
    It contains a body.
* `PUT` is the method that asks the server to edit an existing document.
    It contains a body.
* `GET` is the method that asks the server to send an existing document in the
    body of the response (and not to alter it). The request does not contain a body.
* `HEAD` is the method that asks the server to do everything that it would do in
    for an equivalent `GET` request except for sending the body. Like the `GET`
    request, the `HEAD` request contains no body.

### Receiving and reading and writing and sending
A bunch of things in your web browser might initiate a request. For example, opening
a web page makes one request, and loading an image on the web page makes another request.

A computer somewhere (Call it the "web server".) is running a particular piece of software
(Call it the "HTTP server".) that is able to receive this request.
The HTTP server receives the request, checks that it is valid, and breaks it into the
method, headers, and body.

Then the HTTP server asks something else to decide what to do.
After doing everything, this other thing decides what the outcome was and tells the HTTP server.

The HTTP server composes an HTTP response and
sends that back to the browser.

The browser breaks that into its various parts and accordingly displays a web page,
shows an image or does whatever else was specified.

## A protocol is an expectation
"Protocol" means the same thing for computers as it does for people.
There are lots of different protocols, and some of them are very complicated,
but the word "protocol" itself has a rather simple meaning; it's just
a way that we expect things to work.

Like how we agree to speak the same language (probably English if you're reading this)
or to drive on the same side of the street, we agree on a computer protocol because that
makes it easier for us to make computers communicate. We can choose to build computers
that don't follow standard protocols, but that would make them hard to understand.

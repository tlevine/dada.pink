# On wanting to do nothing
I often say that I want to do "nothing". Here I contemplate what that
means, why I say that, how it affects my conduct, and how it came to be
that I have this attitude.

## What is nothing-doing?
I think that wanting to do "nothing" is about not wanting to have even
the slightest of inconveniences.

The closest things I can think of to doing nothing are to lounge around
the house and sleep all day or to have a boring, monotonous job in a huge
organization.

Taking pleasant walks in peaceful places is too much for me; to partake
in such a walk, I need to verify that I have appropriate clothing, enough
food and water not to get hungry or thirsty, access to a bathroom, and
some idea of how to get where I want to go. And if I really enjoy the walk,
the part that I enjoy is napping in a place that sounds and smells nice,
so I also need to find a place where napping is acceptable/legal. This is
all a lot of work, so I usually don't do it and hope for the best.

## General apathy
I see no purpose in most productive/purposeful things.

To start, nothing actually matters because I'll be dead in less than 100
years and human civilization in general will probably be gone within like
100,000 years. 

I usually think of this in shorter terms, though. People apparently
like the stuff I write, but why do I care whether they like it?

Sometimes it has a very clear, practical use, like when people follow
my directions on [parsing PDF files](/!/parsing-pdfs/) and thus save
lots of time in whatever they're doing that involves taking things
from PDF files.

This only defers the pointlessness; people parse PDF files, but hardly
anyone actually looks at the resulting analysis. (Or do they? Tell me
if I'm wrong.) I think that what usually happens is that the goal is
to convert data formats without having a particular thing you want to
do with the output.

On the other hand, people sometimes do look at the results. Maybe it
gets sent around to several people within whatever field the results
are relevant to. Still, why does it matter?

One time I collected some wonderful data from a bunch of PDFs to
support the work that an environmental advocacy group was doing.
My program picks out specific pieces of information from documents
about proposed earthmoving projects that the group uses to asses
environmental impacts. They had already been trying to collect this
information, and they had several staff and volunteers working on it,
but they still hadn't been able keep up with all of the new projects.

Surely this is a valuable use of PDF parsing, no? Indeed not. To start,
their inability to just throw more people at the problem should give
you a hint that this isn't *that* important. But let's discuss it more
fully. Once this group reviews environmental impacts, it selects
proposals that look particularly reckless and destructive and submits
comments to the appropriate government bodies. Theoretically, someone
in the government reads the comments and considers them, but the
proposals always pass anyway, even when they break rules; there is no
oversight.

I think that the environment-pretecting only happens because the group
gets a bunch of people to all be really really annoying to the government
for a long time. And then the public servants have to be really really
annoying back. We might finally agree to be ever-so-slightly less
horrible in our environment-destroying, but only after hundreds of people
yell back an forth for a really long time. My PDF parsing system just
increases the bickering.

Is a tiny reduction in environmental destruction worth years of stress
to so many people?

I actually feel sort of bad that I have so many computer articles up
here. People really want data science and whatnot to be useful, but I
don't think it really is; people just have to say it's useful because
that's how they get grants and customers and jobs.


## Getting in the way of people


Maybe we should make the world a better place while we're here. That
sounds like a nice idea to me. Unfortunately, I don't think there's much
one can do about this.

So I like things that are reward me *now*, or at least within the next few
months. I think people call this "short-sighted". Or maybe they call it
"living in the moment".


## Effects
Let's start with me seeing no point in most things.


### I want to do "nothing"
I often say that I want to do "nothing". Taking pleasant walks in peaceful
places is too much; I want to lounge around the house and sleep.

Even if I sort of want to do something, I don't really care for it.
Seeing no point in most things,




This is how we get There in fact are
some things I like doing. For example, laying in the moss in the forest
is very pleasant.

# On wanting to do nothing
I often say that I want to do "nothing". Here I contemplate what that
means, why I say that, how it affects my conduct, and how it came to be
that I have this attitude.

## What is nothing-doing?
I think that wanting to do "nothing" is about not wanting to have even
the slightest of inconveniences.

The closest things I can think of to doing nothing are to lounge around
the house and sleep all day or to have a boring, monotonous job in a huge
organization.

Taking pleasant walks in peaceful places is too much for me; to partake
in such a walk, I need to verify that I have appropriate clothing, enough
food and water not to get hungry or thirsty, access to a bathroom, and
some idea of how to get where I want to go. And if I really enjoy the walk,
the part that I enjoy is napping in a place that sounds and smells nice,
so I also need to find a place where napping is acceptable/legal. This is
all a lot of work, so I usually don't do it and hope for the best.

## General apathy
I see no purpose in most productive/purposeful things.

To start, nothing actually matters because I'll be dead in less than 100
years and human civilization in general will probably be gone within like
100,000 years. Most of what we do will be gone forgotten, and why do we
care anyway whether it stays around or gets remembered?

Maybe we should make the world a better place while we're here. That
sounds like a nice idea to me. Unfortunately, I don't think there's much
one can do about this.

So I like things that are reward me *now*, or at least within the next few
months. I think people call this "short-sighted". Or maybe they call it
"living in the moment".


## Effects
Let's start with me seeing no point in most things.

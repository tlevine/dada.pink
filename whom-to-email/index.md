I like to know what my friends lives are like, and they seem
to like to know what mine is like, so I like to send them emails
about what my life is like.

## Whom to email?
I am too friendly, it seems; I always feel like I missed someone.
I tried thinking of more people, but it always seemed arbitrary,
and I still knew I was missing major groups of people. Also,
I wanted to be distinguish between people whom I had communicated
with recently and people whom I hadn't communicated with recently,
as the two groups should receive very different emails.

Surely my computer that is sending the emails could also help me
decide whom to send them to!

## How it works
Conceptually, I am looking for people whom I know very well but don't
talk to anymore, as these are the people I am most likely to have
forgotten to contact. I wrote a program that looks at my email and
tries to approximate this concept.



The present system looks for people whom I've emailed
a lot before but haven't emailed with in a while; it
comes up with a number that is high if I used to email
people a lot and haven't emailed people in a while.
And then it tells me to email the person whose number
is highest.

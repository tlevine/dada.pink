# On modes of transit
I compare the merits of different modes of transit.

## Basic modes


### Airplane
Good things

* It's cheap.
* I can go pretty much anywhere in the world within a couple days.
* I usually go through immigration only at the origin country and
    destination country. Sometimes I have to do it on a transfer.
    This can be far fewer than I need to going over land.

Bad things

* Booking tickets is very difficult.
* I need to prepare bags for security screening.
* I must go to the airport.
* I need to be careful of my speech so that people don't say I'm
    a terrorist. (This probably applies more in the United States
    than elsewhere.)

### Train
Good things

* It's pretty fast.
* Getting to the train station is usually easy.

Bad things

* It's expensive.
* Booking tickets is sometimes difficult.
* I need to pay attention so I don't miss my stop.

### Bicycle
Good things

* Scheduling is very flexible.
* I don't need to book tickets.

Bad things

* I need to carry a bicycle with me.
* I need to carry bicycle tools and locks. This doubles the amount of
    stuff (other than the bicycle itself) that I need to carry.

### Car
Good things

* I can lock things inside a car.
* If I choose the car appropriately, I can sleep in it.

Bad things

* I need to park the car.
* Cars are expensive.
* I need to get a driver's license.

### Walking
Good things

* I don't have to carry much stuff.
* I don't have to book travel tickets.
* It's harder to break laws while walking.

Bad things

* Carrying stuff
* For long distances of walking, I have to plan where I'm going to
    sleep at night.
* It usually takes much longer than other modes of transit.

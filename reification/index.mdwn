# Reification
I just learned a new word! It's "reification". I really like this word.
From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reification_%28fallacy%29),

> From Latin res thing + facere to make, reification can be loosely
> translated as thing-making; the turning of something abstract into
> a concrete thing or object.

I talk a lot about "Things" and "being a thing" and "making [something]
into a thing", but now I have a fancy word for that that I can search for.

## In relation to hip recommender systems
Also, the context in which I learned the word got me thinking about
something interesting. [Sam Tannert](https://soundcloud.com/samueltannert)
commented that much of this fancy social media stuff is "reification of
the center". He was talking about how they recommend that you read
things that everyone is already reading.

I've heard complaints that we don't know whether recommender systems
do anything good; they suggest articles that you might like, but does
this relate to any other outcomes that we care about? Given what Sam
said, I'm now thinking about it a bit differently.

People want to make Things out of things, and here are some things that
we do in order to reify things. We make products, we start companies,
we name our jobs, we sell companies, we win prizes, and we get published
in fancy places. I think we should see reification as a goal in itself,
and a recommender system is a means to this end.
